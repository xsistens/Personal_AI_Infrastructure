description: Transforms product documentation into sales-ready narrative packages combining story explanation, charcoal gestural sketch art, and talking points. Pipeline: extract narrative arc → determine emotional register (wonder, determination, hope) → derive visual scene → generate assets. Three workflows: CreateSalesPackage (full pipeline — narrative + charcoal sketch visual + key talking points), CreateNarrative (story only, 8-24 numbered points in first-person conversational voice, captures why-it-matters not what-it-does), CreateVisual (charcoal gestural sketch with transparent background for presentation versatility). Charcoal gestural sketch is the mandatory visual style — minimalist composition with breathing space. Output is tied directly to what's being sold — clear, succinct, effective. Integrates StoryExplanation (for narrative arc extraction) and Art essay-art workflow (for visual generation) internally.
