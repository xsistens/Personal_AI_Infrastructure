description: "Transforms product documentation into sales-ready narrative packages combining story explanation, charcoal gestural sketch art, and talking points. Pipeline: extract narrative arc → determine emotional register (wonder, determination, hope) → derive visual scene → generate assets. Three workflows: CreateSalesPackage (full pipeline — narrative + charcoal sketch visual + key talking points), CreateNarrative (story only, 8-24 numbered points in first-person conversational voice, captures why-it-matters not what-it-does), CreateVisual (charcoal gestural sketch with transparent background for presentation versatility). Charcoal gestural sketch is the mandatory visual style — minimalist composition with breathing space. Output is tied directly to what's being sold — clear, succinct, effective. Integrates StoryExplanation (for narrative arc extraction) and Art essay-art workflow (for visual generation) internally. USE WHEN: sales, proposal, pitch deck, value proposition, sales narrative, sales deck, sales package, turn this into a pitch, create a sales story, sales materials, product pitch, transform docs to sales, sales script. NOT FOR Hormozi $100M frameworks, value equation, irresistible offer, or VOC mining (use _SALESHORMOZI). NOT FOR standalone diagrams or illustrations (use Art)."

   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the Sales skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

# Sales Skill

**Transform product documentation into compelling sales narratives and visual assets.**

Takes technical documentation, product information, or feature descriptions and produces:
1. **Sales Narratives** - Story explanations that capture the value proposition
2. **Visual Assets** - Charcoal sketch art that conveys the concept visually
3. **Scripts** - Clear, succinct, effective messaging tied to what you're selling

---

## The Pipeline

```
PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION
        ↓
[1] STORY EXPLANATION — Extract the narrative arc (what's the real value?)
        ↓
[2] EMOTIONAL REGISTER — What feeling should this evoke? (wonder, determination, hope, etc.)
        ↓
[3] VISUAL CONCEPT — Derive scene from narrative + emotion
        ↓
[4] GENERATE ASSETS — Create visual + narrative package
        ↓
SALES-READY OUTPUT
```

## Workflows

### Full Sales Package → `Workflows/CreateSalesPackage.md`
**The complete pipeline.** Takes product docs and produces:
- Sales narrative (story explanation)
- Visual asset (charcoal sketch)
- Key talking points

### Sales Narrative Only → `Workflows/CreateNarrative.md`
**Just the story.** Converts technical docs into compelling narrative.

### Visual Asset Only → `Workflows/CreateVisual.md`
**Just the visual.** Creates charcoal sketch art for existing narrative.

---

## Output Format

### Sales Narrative
- 8-24 point story explanation
- First person, conversational
- Captures the "why this matters" not just "what it does"
- Ready for sales scripts, presentations, pitches

### Visual Asset
- Charcoal gestural sketch aesthetic
- Minimalist composition with breathing space
- Transparent background for versatility
- Captures the emotional core of the value proposition

---

## Example

**Input:** Technical documentation about AI code review tool

**Output:**
- **Narrative:** "This tool doesn't just find bugs—it understands your codebase like a senior engineer who's been there for years. It catches the subtle issues that slip through PR reviews..."
- **Visual:** Gestural sketch of human developer and AI figure collaborating, both examining the same code output
- **Talking Points:**
  1. Senior engineer understanding, not just pattern matching
  2. Catches what humans miss in PR reviews
  3. Learns your specific codebase patterns

---

## Integration

This skill combines:
- **storyexplanation skill** - For narrative extraction
- **art skill (essay-art workflow)** - For visual generation
- **Sales-specific framing** - Value proposition focus

---

**The goal:** Sales teams get materials that are highly tied to what they're selling, clear, succinct, and effective.

---

## Examples

**Example 1: Full sales package from docs**
```
User: "create a sales package for this product" [provides docs]
→ Extracts narrative arc using storyexplanation
→ Determines emotional register (wonder, determination, hope)
→ Generates charcoal sketch visual + narrative + talking points
```

**Example 2: Sales narrative only**
```
User: "turn this technical doc into a sales pitch"
→ Reads documentation and extracts value proposition
→ Creates 8-24 point story explanation in first person
→ Returns conversational narrative ready for sales scripts
```

**Example 3: Visual asset for existing narrative**
```
User: "create a visual for this sales story"
→ Analyzes narrative for emotional core
→ Derives scene concept from story + emotion
→ Generates charcoal gestural sketch with transparent background
```

## Gotchas

- **Charcoal sketch art is the visual style for sales assets.** Don't use other art styles unless explicitly asked.
- **Pitch decks must tell a STORY, not list features.** Narrative arc matters more than bullet points.
- **NOT for Hormozi frameworks** — use _SALESHORMOZI for $100M Offers/Leads methodology.

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"Sales","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
