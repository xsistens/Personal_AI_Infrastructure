description: Real Chrome browser automation via Interceptor extension — controls the actual browser from inside (zero CDP fingerprint, passes all major bot detection checks including BrowserScan, Pixelscan, CreepJS, Fingerprint.com). Stays logged in, uses your real sessions. Compound commands (open, read, act, inspect) collapse multi-step flows into single calls. Unique capabilities: monitor/replay system (record user actions → export replayable plan scripts for regression), network log (auto-captures all fetch/XHR), scene graph for rich editors (Google Docs, Canva, Slides). Workflows: VerifyDeploy, Reproduce (open affected page BEFORE code analysis — mandatory per rules), RecordFlow, ReplayFlow, TestForm, Update. MANDATORY for all visual verification — never use agent-browser for deploy confirmation.
