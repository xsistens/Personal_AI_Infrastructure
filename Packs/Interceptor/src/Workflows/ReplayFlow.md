Running **ReplayFlow** in **Interceptor**...

---

Replay a previously recorded user flow to verify it still works after a deploy or code change. Executes the plan script step-by-step, captures the result at each stage, and reports any regressions.

## When to Use

- After deploying changes to a page that has a recorded flow
- As a regression check before merging UI changes
- To verify a bug fix by replaying the flow that exposed the bug
- As part of a deploy verification pipeline alongside VerifyDeploy

## Steps

### 1. Locate the Flow Plan

Recorded flows live in `skills/Interceptor/Flows/`. List available flows:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/Interceptor/Flows/
```

Or regenerate from a monitor session:

```bash
interceptor monitor export <SESSION_ID> --plan
```

### 2. Open the Starting URL

The plan script starts with a `interceptor tab new "<url>"` or `interceptor navigate "<url>"` command. Execute it:

```bash
interceptor open "<START_URL>"
```

### 3. Execute the Plan Step-by-Step

Read the plan file and execute each command sequentially. For each action:

```bash
# Example: click a button
interceptor act "button:Sign In"

# Example: type into a field
interceptor act "textbox:Email" "user@example.com"

# Example: wait for page update
interceptor wait-stable
```

After each action that triggers a page change, verify the expected state:

```bash
interceptor read --text-only
```

Check that the expected content appears. If an element is missing or content differs from expectations, flag it as a regression.

### 4. Verify Network Contracts (Optional)

If the plan includes commented network cues (`# correlated fetch GET /api/...`), verify those endpoints still fire:

```bash
interceptor net log --json
```

Compare against the baseline network log from the original recording. Look for:
- Endpoints that no longer fire (removed API calls)
- Changed response status codes
- New unexpected requests

### 5. Capture Final State

```bash
( cd /tmp/pai-screenshots && interceptor screenshot --save )
```

Compare the final screenshot against the expected end state of the flow.

### 6. Report Results

For each step in the plan, report:
- PASS: action succeeded, expected state confirmed
- FAIL: action failed or unexpected state detected
- REGRESSION: behavior changed from baseline

## Using Batch for Known Flows

For well-tested flows where you trust the commands, use batch execution:

```bash
interceptor batch '[
  {"type": "navigate", "url": "https://example.com"},
  {"type": "wait_stable"},
  {"type": "click", "ref": "button:Sign In"},
  {"type": "wait_stable"},
  {"type": "type", "ref": "textbox:Email", "value": "user@example.com"},
  {"type": "click", "ref": "button:Submit"}
]' --stop-on-error
```

The `--stop-on-error` flag halts on the first failure so you can diagnose the exact regression point.

## Notes

- Semantic selectors (`role:name`) are more resilient than ref IDs (`e5`) — prefer them in flow plans.
- If a selector fails, use `interceptor find "<name>"` to locate the element under its new name.
- Flows recorded on one environment may need URL adjustments for another (staging vs production).
- For flows with password fields, the plan will have `# TODO` comments — substitute values before replay.
- Screenshots from replays can be compared against baseline screenshots for visual regression detection.
