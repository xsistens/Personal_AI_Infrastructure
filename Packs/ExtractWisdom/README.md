description: Content-adaptive wisdom extraction that reads the content first, detects what wisdom domains are actually present, then builds custom sections around what it finds — instead of forcing static headers every time. A security talk gets 'Threat Model Insights' and 'Defense Strategies'; a business podcast gets 'Contrarian Business Takes' and 'Money Philosophy'. Five depth levels: Instant (1 section), Fast (3 sections), Basic (3+takeaway), Full (5-12 sections, default), Comprehensive (10-15+themes). Voice follows the user's conversational style — bullets read like telling a friend what you just watched, not a press release. Output always includes dynamic sections, One-Sentence Takeaway, 'If You Only Have 2 Minutes', and References. Spicy/contrarian takes are mandatory inclusions, never softened. YouTube content extracted via `fabric -y URL` before extraction; article content fetched via WebFetch. Output: markdown with dynamic section headers, closing sections vary by depth level, References & Rabbit Holes, optional Themes & Connections (Comprehensive). Workflow: Extract.
