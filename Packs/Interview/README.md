Phase 2: IDEAL_STATE (HEALTH, MONEY, FREEDOM, RELATIONSHIPS, CREATIVE) in Fill mode. Phase 3: preferences (BOOKS, AUTHORS, BANDS, MOVIES, RESTAURANTS, FOOD_PREFERENCES, LEARNING, MEETUPS, CIVIC) in mixed mode. Phase 4: light touch on CURRENT_STATE/SNAPSHOT and PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY. Phase 9 (RHYTHMS) deferred. Review mode (≥80%) reads file then asks targeted questions one at a time — still accurate, outdated, missing, sharpen? Fill mode (<80%) walks scanner prompts one at a time. The principal answers in natural language; the DA formats into file structure. Voice confirms on actual changes only. Stop signals respected immediately. Target vs. north-star type confirmed per entry. Timestamped backup to TELOS/Backups/ before multi-edit at ≥50% of a file.
