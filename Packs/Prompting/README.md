description: Meta-prompting standard library — the PAI system for generating, optimizing, and composing prompts programmatically. Owns three pillars: Standards (Anthropic Claude 4.x best practices, context engineering principles, 1,500+ paper synthesis, Fabric pattern system, markdown-first / no-XML-tags); Templates (Handlebars-based — Briefing.hbs, Structure.hbs, Gate.hbs, DynamicAgent.hbs, and eval-specific templates Judge.hbs, Rubric.hbs, TestCase.hbs, Comparison.hbs, Report.hbs used by Agents and Evals skills); and Tools (RenderTemplate.ts for CLI/TypeScript rendering with data-content separation). Philosophy: prompts that write prompts — structure is code, content is data. Delivered 65% token reduction across PAI (53K → 18K tokens) via template extraction. Output is always a prompt to be used elsewhere, not final content. Reference files: Standards.md (complete prompt engineering guide), Tools/RenderTemplate.ts (rendering implementation).

# Prompting

Meta-prompting standard library — the PAI system for generating, optimizing, and composing prompts programmatically. Owns three pillars: Standards (Anthropic Claude 4.x best practices, context engineering principles, 1,500+ paper synthesis, Fabric pattern system, markdown-first / no-XML-tags); Templates (Handlebars-based — Briefing.hbs, Structure.hbs, Gate.hbs, DynamicAgent.hbs, and eval-specific templates Judge.hbs, Rubric.hbs, TestCase.hbs, Comparison.hbs, Report.hbs used by Agents and Evals skills); and Tools (RenderTemplate.ts for CLI/TypeScript rendering with data-content separation). Philosophy: prompts that write prompts — structure is code, content is data. Delivered 65% token reduction across PAI (53K → 18K tokens) via template extraction. Output is always a prompt to be used elsewhere, not final content. Reference files: Standards.md (complete prompt engineering guide), Tools/RenderTemplate.ts (rendering implementation).
