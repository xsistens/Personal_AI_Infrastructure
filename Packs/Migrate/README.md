MigrateScan.ts chunks and classifies, producing a routing table with per-target counts and confidence %. MigrateApprove.ts approval loop: --approve-all, --approve-target, --review, --dry-run. UNCLEAR never bulk-approved. Phase 6 delivers summary and /interview recommendation for sparse areas. Confidence: ≥70% auto-approve; 40-70% confirm; <40% walk-through.
