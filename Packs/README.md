# PAI Packs

</div>

Standalone, AI-installable capabilities for Claude Code and other AI agent systems. Each pack is a self-contained directory — point your DA at it and say "install this," and it sets everything up.

Every v5.0.0 skill ships as its own pack below. Each pack contains `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `VERIFY.md`, and `src/` (the actual skill source).

## How to Install

```
"Install the Research pack from PAI/Packs/Research/"
```

Your DA reads `INSTALL.md` and walks through a 5-phase wizard: system analysis, user questions, backup, installation, verification.
