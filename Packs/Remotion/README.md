version: 1.0.0
author: danielmiessler
description: Creates programmatic video with React via Remotion — builds compositions, sequences, and motion graphics rendered to MP4. Uses useCurrentFrame() for all animation (no CSS animations). Integrates PAI_THEME constants from Theme.ts and Art skill aesthetic preferences for visual consistency. Render command: bunx remotion render {composition-id} ~/Downloads/{name}.mp4. Output always to ~/Downloads/ for preview first. Tools: Render.ts (render, list compositions, create projects) and Theme.ts (PAI theme constants derived from Art). Reference docs: ArtIntegration.md (theme constants, color mapping), Patterns.md (code examples, presets), CriticalRules.md (what not to do), Tools/Ref-*.md (31 pattern files covering core Remotion, Lambda, ElevenLabs captions, AI pipeline). Supports ElevenLabs captions, Lambda rendering, and AI pipeline integration. Rendering is CPU-intensive — use run_in_background. Two primary workflows: ContentToAnimation (animate existing content) and GeneratedContentVideo (AI content to video / make a short).
