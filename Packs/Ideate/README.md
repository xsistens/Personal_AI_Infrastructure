description: Evolutionary ideation engine — loop-controlled multi-cycle idea generation through 9 phases (CONSUME, DREAM at noise=0.9, DAYDREAM at noise=0.5, CONTEMPLATE at noise=0.1, STEAL cross-domain borrowing, MATE recombination via Fisher-Yates shuffle, TEST fitness scoring, EVOLVE selection, META-LEARN Lamarckian strategy adjustment). Loop Controller drives adaptive continue/pivot/stop logic with mid-cycle quality checkpoints; strategies evolve across cycles based on what worked. Produces ranked novel solution candidates with full provenance and fitness landscape. Six workflows: FullCycle (all 9 phases adaptive — default), QuickCycle (compressed CONSUME+STEAL+MATE+TEST single cycle), Dream (DREAM phase only), Steal (cross-domain transfer only), Mate (recombination only), Test (fitness evaluation only). Integrates IterativeDepth in CONTEMPLATE, RedTeam in TEST, Council optionally in MATE.

## Installation

This pack is designed for AI-assisted installation. Point your AI at this directory and ask it to install using `INSTALL.md`.

```
"Install the Ideate pack from PAI/Packs/Ideate/"
```

Your AI walks through a 5-phase wizard: system analysis, user questions, backup, installation, verification.
