# BeCreative

Divergent ideation and corpus expansion using Verbalized Sampling + extended thinking. Single-shot mode generates 5 internally diverse candidates (p<0.10 each) and surfaces the strongest. Multi-turn mode expands a small seed corpus (5-20 examples) into a diverse N-example dataset for evals, training, or test sets. Research-backed: Zhang et al. 2025 (arXiv:2510.01171) — 1.6-2.1x diversity increase on creative writing, 25.7% quality improvement, and synthetic-data downstream accuracy lift 30.6% → 37.5% on math benchmarks. Seven workflows: StandardCreativity, MaximumCreativity, IdeaGeneration, TreeOfThoughts, DomainSpecific, TechnicalCreativityGemini3 for algorithmic/architecture work, and SyntheticDataExpansion for VS-Multi corpus growth. Single-shot output is one best response, not a ranked list; SyntheticDataExpansion writes a JSONL corpus to MEMORY/WORK/{slug}/synthetic-data/.
