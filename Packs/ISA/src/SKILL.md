name: ISA
description: "Owns the Ideal State Artifact — the universal primitive that holds the articulated ideal state of any thing (project, task, application, library, infrastructure, work session) as a hard-to-vary explanation. The ISA is a single document that articulates the ideal state, drives the build, verifies the build, and records the evolution of understanding. Five workflows: Scaffold (generate a fresh ISA from a prompt at a specified effort tier), Interview (adaptive question-and-answer to fill in or deepen sections), CheckCompleteness (score an existing ISA against the tier completeness gate and report gaps), Reconcile (deterministic merge of an ephemeral feature-file excerpt back into the master ISA, keyed on stable ISC IDs), Seed (bootstrap a draft project ISA from an existing repository's README, code structure, and recent commits). Examples directory contains canonical-isa.md (the showpiece reference, fully populated across all twelve sections), e1-minimal.md (90-second task — Goal + Criteria only), e3-project.md (mid-size project with eight sections), e5-comprehensive.md (full application with all twelve sections plus a populated changelog history). Twelve-section body order is locked: Problem, Vision, Out of Scope, Principles, Constraints, Goal, Criteria, Test Strategy, Features, Decisions, Changelog, Verification. The skill is invoked automatically by the Algorithm at OBSERVE for any non-trivial task and may also be invoked directly by the user to scaffold or audit an ISA outside an Algorithm run. USE WHEN: any prompt mentions ideal state, ISA, ISC, ideal state criteria, ideal state artifact, project specification, hill-climb on a task, articulating done, scaffolding an ISA, interviewing for an ISA, checking ISA completeness, reconciling an ephemeral feature file back to a master ISA, or seeding an ISA from an existing project. NOT FOR creating new skills (use CreateSkill), running the Algorithm itself (the Algorithm invokes this skill), generating non-ISA artifacts (this skill owns the ISA primitive only), or after-the-fact write-ups like postmortems, decision logs, or engineering journals (those are retrospective; the ISA is a commitment-time scaffold for ideal state)."

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

# ISA — Ideal State Artifact

The ISA is the single document that articulates "done" for any thing whose ideal state we are pursuing — a project, an application, a library, infrastructure, a work session, an art piece, a strategic decision. It serves five identities simultaneously: ideal state articulation, test harness, build verification, done condition, system of record.

This skill owns the canonical template, the workflows that generate and refine ISAs, and the example library.

---

## The Twelve-Section Body (locked v6.2.0)

Every ISA may have up to twelve body sections. The tier completeness gate decides which are required at which effort tier; sections never appear empty. **Order is fixed**.

| # | Section | Purpose | Written At |
|---|---------|---------|------------|
| 1 | `## Problem` | What is broken or missing right now that makes the ideal state worth pursuing | OBSERVE |
| 2 | `## Vision` | What euphoric surprise looks like — experiential intent, 1–5 sentences | OBSERVE |
| 3 | `## Out of Scope` | Anti-vision — what is *not* included in this ideal state, declared upfront in prose | OBSERVE |
| 4 | `## Principles` | Substrate-independent truths (Deutsch reach) the work must respect | OBSERVE |
| 5 | `## Constraints` | Immovable architectural mandates that bound the solution space | OBSERVE |
| 6 | `## Goal` | The hard-to-vary spine — 1–3 sentences naming verifiable done | OBSERVE |
| 7 | `## Criteria` | Atomic ISCs (Ideal State Criteria) — one binary tool probe each, including derived `Anti:` ISCs | OBSERVE → EXECUTE |
| 8 | `## Test Strategy` | Per-ISC verification approach — `isc | type | check | threshold | tool` | OBSERVE/PLAN |
| 9 | `## Features` | Work breakdown — `name | description | satisfies: [ISC-N…] | depends_on: [feature…] | parallelizable: bool` | PLAN |
| 10 | `## Decisions` | Timestamped decision log including dead ends; `refined:` prefix for Goal/ISC restructures | any phase |
| 11 | `## Changelog` | Conjecture / refuted-by / learned / criterion-now entries — Deutsch error-correction trail | LEARN |
| 12 | `## Verification` | Evidence that each ISC passed — quoted command output, file content, screenshot path | VERIFY |

---

## Three-Guardrail Taxonomy (Principles vs Constraints vs Anti-criteria)

Adjacent concepts. Distinguished by **who they bind**.

| Guardrail | Binds | Tone | Example | Lives In |
|-----------|-------|------|---------|----------|
| **Principles** | The *thinking* | Aspirational, generalizable | "User-facing systems prioritize responsiveness." | `## Principles` |
| **Constraints** | The *solution space* | Immovable, non-negotiable | "We do not roll our own cryptography — OAuth via industry-standard libraries only." | `## Constraints` |
| **Out of Scope** | The *vision* | Declared, explicit, prose | "Mobile native apps are not part of v1." | `## Out of Scope` |
| **Anti-criteria** | The *test surface* | Granular, testable, yes/no | "Anti: /admin returns 200 in v1 build." | `## Criteria` (with `Anti:` prefix) |

The first three are author-stated (declarative). Anti-criteria are derived — they are how Out of Scope, Constraints, and Principles become probe-able.

---

## Tier Completeness Gate (HARD at all tiers)

Mirrors the v6.1.0 thinking-floor non-relaxability. Required sections per tier:

| Tier | Required Sections |
|------|-------------------|
| **E1** | Goal, Criteria |
| **E2** | Problem, Goal, Criteria, Test Strategy |
| **E3** | Problem, Vision, Out of Scope, Constraints, Goal, Criteria, Features, Test Strategy |
| **E4** | All twelve sections |
| **E5** | All twelve + active Interview workflow run before BUILD |

**Project ISA override:** any `<project>/ISA.md` requires E3+ structure regardless of the active task's tier. The project file is the long-lived source of truth; one transient E1 task must not downgrade it.

`CheckCompleteness` workflow enforces this gate. A miss blocks `phase: complete` until the missing sections are filled in.

---

## Workflow Routing

Match the verb in the request to a workflow. When ambiguous, default to Scaffold for new ISAs and CheckCompleteness for audits.

| Verb / Intent | Workflow | File |
|---------------|----------|------|
| "scaffold", "create", "generate", "new ISA from this prompt", "extract feature as ephemeral" | **Scaffold** | `Workflows/Scaffold.md` |
| "interview me", "fill in the ISA", "deepen", "ask me questions" | **Interview** | `Workflows/Interview.md` |
| "check", "audit", "score this ISA", "is it complete?" | **CheckCompleteness** | `Workflows/CheckCompleteness.md` |
| "reconcile", "merge feature file back", "ephemeral → master" | **Reconcile** | `Workflows/Reconcile.md` |
| "seed", "bootstrap from this repo", "draft an ISA from existing code" | **Seed** | `Workflows/Seed.md` |
| "append decision", "append changelog", "append verification", "record C/R/L entry" | **Append** | `Workflows/Append.md` |

**When executing a workflow, output this notification directly:**

## Gotchas

The highest-information-density part of this skill. Each entry captures a non-obvious failure mode that has bitten real ISA work.

- **ID-stability is the cornerstone of Reconcile — never re-number on edit.** When the Splitting Test produces a finer-grained version of `ISC-7`, preserve `ISC-7` as the parent and add `ISC-7.1`, `ISC-7.2`, etc. Even when an ISC is dropped, leave a tombstone (`- [ ] ISC-N: [DROPPED — see Decisions YYYY-MM-DD]`). Reconcile keys on stable IDs; renumbering breaks ephemeral feature-file merges silently and the failure mode looks like "the worker's checkmarks didn't land in master."
- **Ephemeral files are derived views, never sources of truth.** Scaffold's `--ephemeral` mode produces a slice of the master ISA at `MEMORY/WORK/{slug}/_ephemeral/<feature>.md`. Workers operate against that slice; Reconcile merges back. Hand-editing master content from an ephemeral file is policy-forbidden — the master is what persists; the ephemeral is what gets archived.
- **The Changelog format is non-negotiable.** Every entry needs all four pieces (`conjectured`, `refuted by`, `learned`, `criterion now`) in that order. Append refuses to write a partial C/R/L; if any of the four is missing, the entry is a Decision, not a Changelog. The format is what makes the Deutsch error-correction trail auditable across sessions.
- **Project ISAs upgrade tier to `max(declared, E3)` regardless of the active task's tier.** A `<project>/ISA.md` is the long-lived system of record for a thing with persistent identity. One transient E1 task on the project must NOT downgrade the structural minimum. CheckCompleteness applies this override automatically.
- **Empty sections never appear.** The twelve-section body is a *capacity*, not a *requirement* at every tier. Sections required-but-empty for the tier are populated; sections not required and not yet written are simply absent from the file. CheckCompleteness distinguishes `present` / `thin` / `missing` / `empty` and only `empty` is acceptable for `Verification` before VERIFY phase.
- **Anti-criteria are derived from Out of Scope plus regression-prevention concerns.** They are how the prose-guardrails (Out of Scope, Constraints, Principles) become probe-able. At least one is required at every tier; the absence of an anti-criterion at OBSERVE is a hard CheckCompleteness failure.
- **Antecedents are required when the goal is experiential.** For art, design, content, and anything that has to "land," at least one ISC must use the `Antecedent:` prefix to name a precondition that reliably produces the target experience. Verifiable goals (build, deploy, schema) don't need antecedents; experiential goals always do.
- **Reconcile is deterministic — there are no conflicts to resolve.** Either an ISC ID exists in master (mechanical merge) or it doesn't (abort with ID-stability violation). If the ephemeral made structural changes (split ISC-7 into ISC-7.1/ISC-7.2), those structural changes belong in master via a separate Edit by the user *before* Reconcile runs.
- **The format spec wins on contradiction.** `IsaFormat.md` is the file-shape contract. If this skill's prose ever drifts from the format spec, the spec is canonical and the skill updates to match — not the reverse.

## Examples

The `Examples/` directory holds twelve reference ISAs spanning the tier (E1–E5) × domain (code / art / design / ops / marketplace / enterprise) matrix. Always start by reading the canonical showpiece before scaffolding a new ISA — copy its section headers, then populate. Pick the example closest to your domain + scale as a template.

**Showpiece**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Examples/canonical-isa.md` | **BeanLine** — peer-to-peer specialty-coffee marketplace. The showpiece reference, fully populated across all twelve sections with real-feeling Decisions and a four-piece C/R/L Changelog. Read this first. |

**Code**

| File | Tier | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `Examples/e1-minimal.md` | E1 | Add a `--no-color` flag to a CLI tool. <90s task, Goal + 4 ISCs only. Demonstrates the fast-path floor. |
| `Examples/e2-backup-verify.md` | E2 | Add SHA-256 verification to a backup CLI's `--verify` mode. Single-domain, 18 ISCs. |
| `Examples/e3-project.md` | E3 | Build an arxiv metadata extractor CLI. Mid-size project, 12 ISCs, eight sections. |
| `Examples/e4-api-migration.md` | E4 | Migrate a public API from REST to GraphQL with 6-month backwards-compat. Cross-cutting, 73 ISCs, all twelve sections. |
| `Examples/e5-desktop-app.md` | E5 | **WattWatch** — open-source desktop app for personal home-energy monitoring. Single-user app pattern, 50 ISCs, populated Changelog. |

**Art (experiential — antecedents required)**

| File | Tier | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `Examples/e3-essay.md` | E3 | Write a 1500-word essay on a specific thesis. Experiential goal, antecedent ISCs, post-publish reception probes. |
| `Examples/e5-album.md` | E5 | **Mariner Frequencies** — produce a 12-track instrumental album over 6 months. Long-form experiential, multi-act Changelog. |

**Design (experiential)**

| File | Tier | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `Examples/e3-help-redesign.md` | E3 | Redesign a CLI tool's `--help` output for first-encounter clarity. Antecedents + usability tests. |
| `Examples/e4-brand-identity.md` | E4 | **Cardinal** — brand identity for a small fintech startup (logo + type + color + voice + first 5 marketing surfaces). 56 ISCs, 6 antecedents. |

**Ops**

| File | Tier | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `Examples/e2-rotate-credential.md` | E2 | Rotate a production deploy credential in CI. Demonstrates the ISA primitive applied to ops/runbook work. 16 ISCs. |

**Enterprise**

| File | Tier | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `Examples/e5-enterprise.md` | E5 | **Beacon Health Alliance** — multi-region HIPAA-compliant patient portal for a 50-hospital network. Compliance anti-criteria, multi-team parallelizable features, 68 ISCs across all twelve sections. |

## ID Stability Rule

**ISC IDs never re-number on edit.** When the Splitting Test produces a finer-grained version of `ISC-7`, the original number is preserved as the parent and children become `ISC-7.1`, `ISC-7.2`, etc. Do not collapse the numbering even if the ISC is dropped — leave a tombstone marker so historical references in Decisions, Changelog, and Verification remain valid.

This rule exists because `Reconcile` is keyed on ISC IDs. If IDs renumber across edits, ephemeral feature-file reconciliation breaks silently. The renumbering ban is what makes feature-file workflows safe.

---

## Ephemeral Feature Files (Ralph Loop / Maestro pattern)

When a feature is to be worked in an isolated context (Ralph Loop, Maestro, parallel coding-agent instances), the Algorithm invokes:

```
Skill("ISA", "extract feature <name> as ephemeral file")
```

`Scaffold` (with `--ephemeral` mode) produces a derived view at `MEMORY/WORK/{slug}/_ephemeral/<feature>.md` containing only the slice relevant to that feature: the Vision and Goal as read-only context, the relevant Constraints, the ISCs in the feature's `satisfies:` list with stable IDs, the matching Test Strategy entries, and an empty Verification section.

A fresh-context agent operates against the ephemeral file alone. At completion, `Reconcile` deterministically merges ISC checkmarks, Verification evidence, Decisions entries, and any new Changelog entries back to master, then archives the ephemeral file under `_ephemeral/.archive/`.

**Ephemeral files are derived views. They are never sources of truth. They are never hand-edited as policy. The master ISA is what persists.**

---

## Relationship to the Algorithm

The Algorithm at OBSERVE invokes this skill to scaffold or read an ISA. The skill does not run the Algorithm — it owns the artifact the Algorithm operates on.

- OBSERVE: `Skill("ISA", "scaffold from prompt at tier T")` → returns populated ISA at canonical location.
- OBSERVE: `Skill("ISA", "check completeness of <path> at tier T")` → pass/fail + gap report.
- PLAN: `Skill("ISA", "extract feature <name> as ephemeral file")` → ephemeral excerpt.
- LEARN: `Skill("ISA", "reconcile <ephemeral-path> → <master-path>")` → deterministic merge.

The Algorithm doctrine spec at `~/.claude/PAI/ALGORITHM/v6.2.0.md` (or LATEST) governs invocation cadence. This skill is invocation-agnostic — it works the same whether called by the Algorithm or directly by the user.

---

## Format spec cross-reference

The full ISA format spec lives at `~/.claude/PAI/DOCUMENTATION/IsaFormat.md`. This skill implements that spec; if there is ever a contradiction, the format spec wins and this skill is updated to match.

The system-architecture doc — five identities, three-guardrail taxonomy, twelve-section body, six workflows, two homes, subsystem relationships — lives at `~/.claude/PAI/DOCUMENTATION/Isa/IsaSystem.md`. Read that for the conceptual frame; read this file (and `IsaFormat.md`) for the operational contract.
