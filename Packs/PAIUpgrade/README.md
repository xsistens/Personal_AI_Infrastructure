description: Generate prioritized PAI upgrade recommendations via 4 parallel threads: Thread 0 (prior-work audit — reads current Algorithm, PATTERNS.yaml, hooks, settings, recent ISAs, and KNOWLEDGE to assign Prior Status tags), Thread 1 (user context — TELOS goals, active projects, PAI system state), Thread 2 (source collection — Anthropic releases, YouTube channels, GitHub trending, custom sources), Thread 3 (internal reflections — Algorithm execution Q1/Q2 patterns). Output format: Discoveries table ranked by interestingness, then tiered Recommendations (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) each with Prior Status (NEW/PARTIAL/DISCUSSED/REJECTED/DONE), then full Technique Details with before/after code. Every recommendation cites file:line evidence from Thread 0 — already-implemented items go to Skipped, never re-surfaced. Workflows: Upgrade, MineReflections, AlgorithmUpgrade, ResearchUpgrade, FindSources, TwitterBookmarks.

# PAIUpgrade

Generate prioritized PAI upgrade recommendations via 4 parallel threads: Thread 0 (prior-work audit — reads current Algorithm, PATTERNS.yaml, hooks, settings, recent ISAs, and KNOWLEDGE to assign Prior Status tags), Thread 1 (user context — TELOS goals, active projects, PAI system state), Thread 2 (source collection — Anthropic releases, YouTube channels, GitHub trending, custom sources), Thread 3 (internal reflections — Algorithm execution Q1/Q2 patterns). Output format: Discoveries table ranked by interestingness, then tiered Recommendations (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) each with Prior Status (NEW/PARTIAL/DISCUSSED/REJECTED/DONE), then full Technique Details with before/after code. Every recommendation cites file:line evidence from Thread 0 — already-implemented items go to Skipped, never re-surfaced. Workflows: Upgrade, MineReflections, AlgorithmUpgrade, ResearchUpgrade, FindSources, TwitterBookmarks.

## Installation
