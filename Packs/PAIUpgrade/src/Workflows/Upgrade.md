Running the **Upgrade** workflow in the **PAIUpgrade** skill to check for upgrades...

**Primary workflow for PAIUpgrade skill.** Generates prioritized upgrade recommendations by running four parallel agent threads: prior-work audit, user context analysis, source collection, and internal reflection mining.

**Trigger:** "check for upgrades", "upgrade", "any updates", "check Anthropic", "check YouTube", "pai upgrade"

---

## Overview

Four parallel threads, then synthesize:

0. **Thread 0 (MANDATORY):** Prior-Work Audit — inventory current Algorithm, PATTERNS.yaml, hooks, skills, recent ISAs, KNOWLEDGE, feedback memory.
1. **Thread 1:** User context (TELOS, projects, recent work, PAI state).
2. **Thread 2:** External sources (Anthropic, YouTube, custom, GitHub trending).
3. **Thread 3:** Internal reflections (algorithm-reflections.jsonl).
4. **Synthesize:** filter discoveries against Thread 0 inventory; assign Prior Status; emit deltas only.
5. **Output:** prioritized upgrade report — every recommendation row carries Prior Status with file:line evidence.

Thread 0 output gates synthesis. No recommendation may be emitted without a Prior Status tag citing evidence from Thread 0.

---

## Execution

### Step 0: Launch Thread 0 — Prior-Work Audit (MANDATORY)

Spawn 5 parallel agents (`subagent_type=Explore`) to inventory current PAI state. Each returns an inventory with file:line evidence.

**Agent 0a — Algorithm & Capabilities**
Read: `~/.claude/PAI/ALGORITHM/LATEST` + the file it points to, `~/.claude/PAI/ALGORITHM/capabilities.md`, `mode-detection.md`, `~/.claude/PAI/DOCUMENTATION/Algorithm/AlgorithmSystem.md`.
Extract: phase definitions and gates, verification doctrine (advisor rules, live-probe, conflict resolution), preflight gates, capabilities table, mode-detection triggers, browser-first / env-probe / feedback-memory-lookup / parallelization rules.
Return: state inventory with file:line evidence, ≤500 words.

**Agent 0b — Security Patterns & Inspectors**
Read: `~/.claude/PAI/USER/SECURITY/PATTERNS.yaml`, `~/.claude/hooks/SecurityPipeline.hook.ts`, `~/.claude/hooks/security/pipeline.ts`, `~/.claude/hooks/security/inspectors/*.ts`.
Extract: every pattern category (name + regex summary + action), inspector coverage (Pattern, Egress, Rules, Prompt, Injection), Bash bypass coverage (backslash-escaped flags, /dev/tcp/, /dev/udp/, env-var-prefixed commands, /proc/, git filter-branch, ptrace), deny/ask/allow precedence.
Return: inventory with file:line evidence; flag what's present AND what's missing.

**Agent 0c — Hooks & Settings**
Read: `~/.claude/settings.json` (hooks, env, permissions, pai sections); list `~/.claude/hooks/*.hook.ts`.
Extract: hook inventory by event (SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, PreCompact, etc.), orphaned hooks (on disk but unwired), empty event arrays, notable env/permission/pai values.
Return: inventory with file:line evidence; flag wiring gaps.

**Agent 0d — Recent Decisions & Feedback Memory**
Scan: top 20 most-recent `~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/WORK/` dirs (skim ISAs), `MEMORY/KNOWLEDGE/`, `MEMORY/LEARNING/`, `~/.claude/projects/-$(whoami)--claude/memory/feedback_*.md`, `project_*.md`.
Extract: recent decisions affecting upgrades (rejected/deferred/completed), relevant feedback entries, KNOWLEDGE entries that explicitly evaluated proposals.
Return: inventory with paths; flag anything that would DENY a future recommendation.

**Agent 0e — Skill Surface**
Scan: `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (description fields), `~/.claude/skills/_PAI/TOOLS/*.ts`, `~/.claude/skills/CreateSkill/Tools/*.ts` (validators).
Extract: skill counts/categories, existence of Monitor/Advisor/PreCompact wrappers, CreateSkill description-length cap, ToolActivityTracker capture scope (diffs? stdout? git state?).
Return: inventory with file:line evidence.

**Output of Thread 0:** combined STATE INVENTORY with canonical file:line evidence per capability. Synthesis uses this to assign Prior Status.

### Step 1: Launch Thread 1 — User Context

Spawn 4 parallel agents (`subagent_type=general-purpose`):

**Agent 1 — TELOS:** read `~/.claude/PAI/USER/TELOS/*.md`. Extract current high-priority goals, active focus areas, key challenges, project themes.

**Agent 2 — Recent Work:** read `~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/work.json` and recent `MEMORY/WORK/` dirs (last 7 days). Extract active projects, recurring patterns, open tasks, recent accomplishments.

**Agent 3 — PAI State:** list `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/hooks/`, read `~/.claude/settings.json`. Extract installed skills, active hooks, configuration highlights, obvious gaps or opportunities.

**Agent 4 — Tech Stack:** from PROJECTS.md and recent work, identify primary languages, frameworks, deployment targets, key integrations.

### Step 2: Launch Thread 2 — Source Collection

Spawn 4 parallel agents (`subagent_type=general-purpose`):

**Agent 1 — Anthropic Sources**
Run: `bun ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/Anthropic.ts`.
For each finding (release notes, GitHub commits, doc updates), extract specific techniques: exact syntax/API/configuration, quoted documentation showing usage, which PAI component this improves, before/after code where applicable. Skip findings with no concrete technique. Do NOT return vague "new release available" entries.

**Agent 2 — YouTube Channels**
1. Load channel config: `bun ~/.claude/PAI/TOOLS/LoadSkillConfig.ts ../youtube-channels.json`.
2. For each channel: `yt-dlp --flat-playlist --dump-json 'https://www.youtube.com/@channelhandle/videos' 2>/dev/null | head -5`.
3. Compare against `../State/youtube-videos.json`.
4. For new videos: `bun ~/.claude/PAI/TOOLS/GetTranscript.ts '<video-url>'`.
5. From each transcript, extract specific techniques: code patterns, configurations, command examples, with timestamps and exact quotes. Skip videos with no extractable techniques.

**Agent 3 — Custom Sources**
Check `~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/PAIUpgrade/` for additional source definitions beyond YouTube and GitHub trending. If sources exist, check them for updates. Return findings, or empty list with note "No custom sources configured".

**Agent 4 — GitHub Trending**
1. Load `github_trending` config from `~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/PAIUpgrade/user-sources.json`. If `enabled: false` or missing, return `{ github_trending: false, note: "disabled or not configured" }`.
2. `LOOKBACK_DATE = today - lookback_days` (default 14).
3. For each `query` in `github_trending.queries`:
   ```bash
   gh api 'search/repositories?q=QUERY+created:>LOOKBACK_DATE+stars:>MIN_STARS&sort=SORT&order=desc&per_page=RESULTS' \
     --jq '.items[] | {name, stars, description, url, topics, created, language}'
   ```
4. Dedup against `../State/github-trending.json`.
5. For each NEW repo, read README (`gh api 'repos/OWNER/REPO/readme' --jq '.content' | base64 -d | head -500`). Assess PAI relevance. Extract specific techniques/architectures/patterns. Skip forks, low-quality, irrelevant.
6. Save updated seen-list to `../State/github-trending.json`.
7. Focus on INSPIRATION (architectural decisions, novel approaches), not just repo names.

Return within 90s; reduce per_page to 3 if slow.

### Step 2a: Claude Code Freshness Check (parallel with Thread 2)

Spawn `Agent(subagent_type="claude-code-guide", run_in_background: true)`:

Verify PAI's Claude Code references against the latest API surface. Check: hook event types, slash commands, agent/subagent types, settings.json fields, MCP integration, Agent SDK, Claude API. For each area, return current features, recent additions, deprecated items, and PAI staleness risk (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH). Focus on changes affecting hooks, skills, or Algorithm. Return within 90s.

Output feeds Step 5 (Filter and Score) as source type `Claude Code Guide` and is cross-referenced against current PAI files for staleness.

### Step 2b: Launch Thread 3 — Internal Reflection Mining

Spawn 1 parallel agent (`subagent_type=general-purpose`):

Read `~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/LEARNING/REFLECTIONS/algorithm-reflections.jsonl`. Full methodology: `Workflows/MineReflections.md`. Quick summary:
1. Parse each line as JSON.
2. Prioritize entries with `implied_sentiment <= 5`, `within_budget: false`, or `criteria_failed > 0`.
3. Cluster Q2 answers (algorithm improvements) by similarity.
4. Cluster Q1 answers (execution patterns).
5. Themes with 2+ occurrences (or 1 if sentiment ≤ 4) become upgrade candidates.

Return: entries analyzed (N), date range, list of upgrade candidates (theme, frequency, signal HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW, root cause, proposed fix, target files, supporting Q2 quotes), execution warnings (recurring Q1 mistakes), aspirational insights (Q3 patterns).

If file is missing or empty: `{ entries_analyzed: 0, note: "No reflections found yet — they accumulate after Standard+ Algorithm runs" }`. Return within 60s.

### Step 3: Wait and Collect

Wait for all 14 agents (5 prior-work + 4 context + 4 source + 1 reflection). Thread 0's STATE INVENTORY is the canonical reference document for synthesis.

### Step 4: Synthesize User Context

Merge Thread 1 results into a unified context object covering: TELOS goals/focus/challenges, recent_work projects/patterns/open_tasks, pai_state skills/hooks/config, tech_stack languages/frameworks/deployment.

### Step 5: Filter, Score, Assign Prior Status

For each discovery from Thread 2 (and candidate from Thread 3):

**0. Prior State match (FIRST GATE)** — search Thread 0 inventory for the proposed concept/file/pattern/capability:
- Found with same semantics → ✅ **DONE** → Skipped Content with evidence.
- Subset present → 🔶 **PARTIAL** → scope to missing delta only.
- Deferred idea in ISA/KNOWLEDGE → 💬 **DISCUSSED** → only re-surface if reason changed; cite the change.
- Explicit rejection → 🚫 **REJECTED** → skip unless context warrants revisit; name what changed.
- Not found → 🆕 **NEW**.

**1. Relevance check** — does this relate to user's tech stack / goals / projects?
**2. Score relevance** (1-10), **impact** (1-10), **effort** (1-10, 10=easy).
**3. Priority** = (relevance × 2) + impact + effort.

Filter out relevance < 3. Filter out ✅ DONE (move to Skipped with file:line evidence).

**Mandatory before emitting:** every recommendation row has a Prior Status tag AND file:line evidence from Thread 0.

### Step 6: Generate Prioritized Recommendations

Sort by priority and tier:

- **🔴 CRITICAL** — score > 30, relevance > 8.
- **🟠 HIGH** — score 22-30, relevance > 6.
- **🟡 MEDIUM** — score 14-21, relevance > 4.
- **🟢 LOW** — score < 14, or relevance 3-4.

Each recommendation: short action name, PAI Relevance (primary framing — WHY it matters), effort (Low/Med/High), files affected.

### Step 7: Output Report

**Canonical output format:** `../References/OutputFormat.md`. Reference example: `../References/ExampleReport.md`.

Section order: Discoveries → Recommendations → Technique Details → Internal Reflections → Summary → Skipped → Sources Processed.

**Print only non-empty Recommendation tiers.** Empty tier headers are noise.

**Critical output rules:**
1. Discoveries first, recommendations second, details third.
2. Discoveries ≠ Recommendations — different orderings (interestingness vs priority).
3. PAI Relevance is primary in both tables.
4. Every Recommendation has a Prior Status tag with file:line evidence.
5. Quote the source (actual content or code).
6. Map every technique to a specific PAI file or component.
7. Numbered cross-references consistent across Discoveries → Recommendations → Technique Details.
8. No watch/read recommendations — extract, don't point.
9. Skip boldly — content with no technique → Skipped.
10. Two mandatory description fields, ≤2 sentences each: **What It Is** and **How It Helps PAI**.

### Step 8: Registry Update — Feed Discoveries into Algorithm

For each CRITICAL/HIGH recommendation, evaluate against the gate:

1. **Invokable** — concrete way to use it (tool call, slash command, behavioral pattern).
2. **Useful for Algorithm** — would change capability selection.
3. **Stable** — not experimental/alpha (or labeled as such).
4. **Distinct** — not duplicating an existing capability.
5. **Compact** — describable in one ~20-word table row.

| Discovery Type | Integration Target | Action |
|----------------|--------------------|--------|
| New Claude Code command/skill | Algorithm Platform Capabilities table | Propose new row |
| Enhancement to existing PAI skill | Relevant SKILL.md description | Propose updated description with workflow guidance |
| Useful behavioral pattern | Algorithm Platform Capabilities (Techniques section) | Propose new technique row |
| Major new capability | New PAI skill | Propose scaffold via CreateSkill |

Output:
```markdown
## 🔄 Registry Update Proposals

| Discovery | Gate Pass? | Integration Target | Proposed Change |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| [name] | ✅ All 5 | Algorithm table / SKILL.md | [specific text to add] |
```

If none pass: "No registry updates needed this cycle."

### Step 9: Update State

- `State/last-check.json` — updated by Anthropic.ts.
- `State/youtube-videos.json` — add newly processed video IDs.
- `State/github-trending.json` — add newly seen repo full_names.

### Step 10: Memory Redistribution & Cleanup

Scan `~/.claude/projects/-$(whoami)--claude/memory/MEMORY.md` and each referenced memory file. Triage:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Redundant with system prompt or CLAUDE.md operational notes | Delete file, remove from MEMORY.md |
| Behavioral rule not yet in system prompt | Migrate to PAI_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md (constitutional) or CLAUDE.md (operational), then delete |
| Stale/resolved (problem fixed, project completed, info outdated) | Delete file, remove from MEMORY.md |
| Wrong paths or outdated references | Verify against filesystem; fix or delete |
| Valid project/user/reference, still current | Keep — update if needed |

**Version pointer check:**
- `settings.json pai.algorithmVersion` matches `Algorithm/LATEST`.
- `CLAUDE.md` Algorithm path matches `Algorithm/LATEST`.
- `SYSTEM-README.md` latest version reference matches `Algorithm/LATEST`.

Output:
```
🧹 MEMORY MAINTENANCE:
 Scanned: [N] memory files
 Deleted: [N] (redundant/stale/resolved)
 Migrated: [N] (moved to steering rules)
 Kept: [N] (still valid)
 Version pointers: [all consistent / fixed N mismatches]
```

## Quick Mode

If user says "check Anthropic only" or similar:
- Skip Thread 1 (use cached context if available).
- Run only the relevant Thread 2 agent.
- Lighter filtering.
- Abbreviated report.

## Error Handling

- Thread 1 fails → proceed with minimal context, note in output.
- Thread 2 fails → report which sources couldn't be checked.
- No discoveries → "No new updates found" with sources listed.
- All filtered → "Updates found but none relevant to current focus".

## Integration

- Triggered automatically (cron) or by user command.
- Discoveries feed `ResearchUpgrade` for deep dives.
- Recommendations can generate todos.
- Can trigger implementation workflows.

## Reference Example

See `../References/ExampleReport.md` for a complete worked example of the canonical output shape.

**This workflow implements the core PAIUpgrade value proposition: understanding YOU first, discovering what's new second, then connecting them into actionable, personalized upgrades.**
