name: BrightData
description: "4-tier progressive scraping with automatic escalation: Tier 1 WebFetch (fast, built-in), Tier 2 curl with Chrome headers (basic bot bypass), Tier 3 agent-browser (headless JavaScript rendering via Rust CLI daemon), Tier 4 Bright Data MCP proxy (CAPTCHA, advanced bot detection, residential proxies). Two workflows: FourTierScrape for single URLs, Crawl for multi-page site mapping (light crawl via scrape_batch loop up to 50 pages, or full crawl via Bright Data Crawl API). Always starts at Tier 1 and escalates only when blocked — Tier 4 has usage costs. Outputs URL content in markdown format. USE WHEN Bright Data, scrape URL, web scraping, bot detection, crawl site, CAPTCHA, can't access, site blocking, extract page content, scrape whole site, spider domain, convert URL to markdown, getting blocked. NOT FOR headless batch automation without scraping need (use Browser). NOT FOR simple public content (use WebFetch directly). NOT FOR real-browser bot bypass where staying logged in and zero CDP fingerprint matter (use Interceptor). Playwright is banned across PAI."

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/BrightData/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.


## 🚨 MANDATORY: Voice Notification (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY ACTION)

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the BrightData skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **BrightData** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

## Workflow Routing

**When executing a workflow, output this notification directly:**

```
Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **Brightdata** skill to ACTION...
```

**Route to the appropriate workflow based on the request.**

**When user requests scraping/fetching a single URL:**
Examples: "scrape this URL", "fetch this page", "get content from [URL]", "pull content from this site", "retrieve [URL]", "can't access this site", "this site is blocking me", "use Bright Data to fetch"
→ **READ:** Workflows/FourTierScrape.md
→ **EXECUTE:** Four-tier progressive scraping workflow (WebFetch → Curl → Browser Automation → Bright Data MCP)

**When user requests crawling multiple pages from a site:**
Examples: "crawl this site", "crawl all pages under /docs", "spider this domain", "map this website", "get all pages from", "crawl [URL]", "scrape the whole site", "extract all pages"
→ **READ:** Workflows/Crawl.md
→ **EXECUTE:** Crawl workflow (Light Crawl for <50 pages, Full Crawl via Bright Data Crawl API for larger sites)

## When to Activate This Skill

### Direct Scraping Requests (Categories 1-4)
- "scrape this URL", "scrape [URL]", "scrape this page"
- "fetch this URL", "fetch [URL]", "fetch this page", "fetch content from"
- "pull content from [URL]", "pull this page", "pull from this site"
- "get content from [URL]", "retrieve [URL]", "retrieve this page"

- "basic scrape", "quick scrape", "simple fetch"
- "comprehensive scrape", "deep scrape", "full content extraction"

### Access & Bot Detection Issues (Categories 5-7)
- "can't access this site", "site is blocking me", "getting blocked"
- "bot detection", "CAPTCHA", "access denied", "403 error"
- "need to bypass bot detection", "get around blocking"
- "this URL won't load", "can't fetch this page"
- "use Bright Data", "use the scraper", "use advanced scraping"

### Result-Oriented Requests (Category 8)
- "get me the content from [URL]"
- "extract text from [URL]"
- "download this page content"
- "convert [URL] to markdown"
- "need the HTML from this site"

### Crawling Requests (Categories 9-11)
- "crawl this site", "crawl [URL]", "spider this domain"
- "map this website", "get all pages from [URL]", "scrape the whole site"
- "crawl all pages under /docs", "extract all pages from", "site crawl"
- "get every page on this site", "full site extraction"
- "crawl depth 3", "crawl up to 50 pages"

### Use Case Indicators
- User needs web content for research or analysis
- Standard methods (WebFetch) are failing
- Site has bot detection or rate limiting
- Need reliable content extraction
- Converting web pages to structured format (markdown)
- User needs multiple pages from a site, not just one
- User wants to map a site's structure or extract a section

## Core Capabilities

**Progressive Escalation Strategy:**
1. **Tier 1: WebFetch** - Fast, simple, built-in Claude Code tool
2. **Tier 2: Customized Curl** - Chrome-like browser headers to bypass basic bot detection
3. **Tier 3: agent-browser** - Headless browser automation via agent-browser Rust CLI daemon for JavaScript-heavy sites. Playwright is banned across PAI.
4. **Tier 4: Bright Data MCP** - Professional scraping service that handles CAPTCHA and advanced bot detection

**Key Features:**
- Automatic fallback between tiers
- Preserves content in markdown format
- Handles bot detection and CAPTCHA
- Works with any URL
- Efficient resource usage (only escalates when needed)

---

## Workflow Overview

**FourTierScrape.md** - Complete URL content scraping with four-tier fallback strategy
- **When to use:** Any single URL content retrieval request
- **Process:** Start with WebFetch → If fails, use curl with Chrome headers → If fails, use Browser Automation → If fails, use Bright Data MCP
- **Output:** URL content in markdown format

**Crawl.md** - Multi-page crawling with link discovery and site mapping
- **When to use:** Crawling multiple pages from a site, mapping site structure, extracting a section
- **Process:** Light Crawl (MCP scrape_batch + link extraction loop, up to 50 pages) or Full Crawl (Bright Data Crawl API for entire sites)
- **Output:** Site map + page contents in markdown, with crawl stats and cost summary

---

## Extended Context

**Integration Points:**
- **WebFetch Tool** - Built-in Claude Code tool for basic URL fetching
- **Bash Tool** - For executing curl commands with custom headers
- **Browser Automation** - agent-browser headless daemon for JavaScript rendering
- **Bright Data MCP** - `mcp__Brightdata__scrape_as_markdown` and `scrape_batch` for advanced scraping
- **Bright Data Crawl API** - HTTP POST to `api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/trigger` for full-site crawls

**When Each Tier Is Used:**
- **Tier 1 (WebFetch):** Simple sites, public content, no bot detection
- **Tier 2 (Curl):** Sites with basic user-agent checking, simple bot detection
- **Tier 3 (agent-browser):** Sites requiring JavaScript execution, dynamic content loading
- **Tier 4 (Bright Data):** Sites with CAPTCHA, advanced bot detection, residential proxy requirements

**Configuration:**
No configuration required - all tools are available by default in Claude Code

## Gotchas

- **4-tier escalation: WebFetch → curl → agent-browser → Bright Data proxy.** Always start at Tier 1 and escalate only when blocked. Playwright is banned across PAI.
- **Bright Data proxy has usage costs.** Don't use Tier 4 for sites accessible via Tier 1-3.
- **CAPTCHA-solving introduces latency.** Allow extra time for Tier 4 responses.
- **Credentials in `~/.claude/.env`** — BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY.

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"BrightData","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
