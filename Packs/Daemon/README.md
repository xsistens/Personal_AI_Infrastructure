DaemonAggregator.ts reads PAI sources (TELOS missions/goals/books/wisdom, KNOWLEDGE/Ideas titles, PROJECTS.md, MEMORY/WORK themes, PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY bio) and writes to daemon-data.json. SecurityFilter.ts applies deterministic pattern-matching (NOT LLM judgment) to strip names, paths, credentials, and internal refs. Structurally excludes CONTACTS, FINANCES, HEALTH, OUR_STORY, OPINIONS. deploy.sh builds the VitePress static site and deploys to Cloudflare Pages. Two-repo pattern: public framework (danielmiessler/Daemon, forkable) + private content (daemon-dm). Workflows: UpdateDaemon, ReadDaemon, PreviewDaemon, DeployDaemon.

DaemonAggregator.ts reads PAI sources (TELOS missions/goals/books/wisdom, KNOWLEDGE/Ideas titles, PROJECTS.md, MEMORY/WORK themes, PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY bio) and writes to daemon-data.json. SecurityFilter.ts applies deterministic pattern-matching (NOT LLM judgment) to strip names, paths, credentials, and internal refs. Structurally excludes CONTACTS, FINANCES, HEALTH, OUR_STORY, OPINIONS. deploy.sh builds the VitePress static site and deploys to Cloudflare Pages. Two-repo pattern: public framework (danielmiessler/Daemon, forkable) + private content (daemon-dm). Workflows: UpdateDaemon, ReadDaemon, PreviewDaemon, DeployDaemon.
