## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Daemon/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any SecurityOverrides.md or PREFERENCES.md found there. These override default security classification. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.

# Daemon Skill

Manages your public daemon profile — a living digital representation of what you're working on, thinking about, reading, and building. Automatically aggregates data from your PAI system with deterministic security filtering to ensure only publicly safe content is published.

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| **UpdateDaemon** | "update daemon", "refresh daemon" | `Workflows/UpdateDaemon.md` |
| **ReadDaemon** | "read daemon", "check daemon", "daemon status" | `Workflows/ReadDaemon.md` |
| **PreviewDaemon** | "preview daemon", "daemon diff" | `Workflows/PreviewDaemon.md` |
| **DeployDaemon** | "deploy daemon", "push daemon", "ship daemon" | `Workflows/DeployDaemon.md` |

## Architecture

Two-repo pattern: public framework + private content.

```
PAI SOURCES (private, read-only)
  TELOS/ (missions, goals, books, movies, wisdom)
  KNOWLEDGE/Ideas/ (title + thesis only)
  PROJECTS.md (public projects only)
  MEMORY/WORK/ (abstracted to topic themes)
  PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY.md (public bio data)
    │
    ├──[DaemonAggregator.ts]──→ Reads sources, merges with existing data
    │
    ├──[SecurityFilter.ts]──→ Deterministic code-level allowlist filter
    │                          Strips names, paths, credentials, internal refs
    │                          NOT an LLM filter — enforced by pattern matching
    │
    └──→ daemon-data.json → ~/Projects/daemon-dm/ (PRIVATE repo)
              │
              └──[deploy.sh]──→ Copies JSON into framework → VitePress build → Cloudflare Pages
                                    │
                              ~/Projects/daemon/ (PUBLIC repo — forkable framework)

    STRUCTURALLY EXCLUDED (never read):
          CONTACTS.md, FINANCES/, HEALTH/, TRAUMAS.md,
          KNOWLEDGE/People/, KNOWLEDGE/Companies/,
          OUR_STORY.md, OPINIONS.md, BUSINESS/
```

## Important Paths

| Purpose | Path |
|---------|------|
| **Private data repo** | `~/Projects/daemon-dm/` |
| **daemon-data.json** | `~/Projects/daemon-dm/daemon-data.json` |
| **Deploy script** | `~/Projects/daemon-dm/deploy.sh` |
| **Public framework repo** | `~/Projects/daemon/` |
| **Security classification** | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Docs/SecurityClassification.md` |
| **Security overrides** | `${PAI_USER_DIR}/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Daemon/SecurityOverrides.md` |

## Live Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `daemon.example.com` | Public website (Cloudflare Pages, fully static) |

## Security Philosophy

1. **Private by default:** All data is private until explicitly classified as public
2. **Code-level enforcement:** SecurityFilter.ts is deterministic pattern matching, NOT LLM judgment
3. **Structural exclusion:** Sensitive files (CONTACTS, FINANCES, HEALTH) are never opened by the aggregator
4. **Defense in depth:** Aggregator filter + SecurityFilter + pre-commit hook + manual approval
5. **Fail closed:** If uncertain, exclude the content

## Data Sources

The DaemonAggregator reads from these PAI sources:

| Source | What's Extracted | Section |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| TELOS/MISSION.md | M1, M2 (public missions) | [MISSION] |
| TELOS/GOALS.md | Public project goals | [TELOS] |
| TELOS/BOOKS.md | Book titles | [FAVORITE_BOOKS] |
| TELOS/MOVIES.md | Movie titles | [FAVORITE_MOVIES] |
| TELOS/WISDOM.md | Top 5 quotes | [WISDOM] |
| KNOWLEDGE/Ideas/_index.md | 10 recent Ideas (title + thesis) | [RECENT_IDEAS] |
| PROJECTS.md | Public repos and sites | Projects integration |
| MEMORY/WORK/ | Topic themes (last 14 days) | [CURRENTLY_WORKING_ON] |
| PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY.md | Public bio, role, focus | [ABOUT] |
| Existing daemon.md | Preserved sections (predictions, routine, podcasts, preferences) | Various |

## For Community Forks

This skill is designed to be generic:

1. Fork the public Daemon repo (danielmiessler/Daemon)
2. Create your own private data repo with `daemon-data.json`
3. Configure  with your own blocked names/paths
4. The aggregator reads from standard PAI directory structure
5. Use `deploy.sh` to build and deploy to your own Cloudflare Pages

## Examples

**Example 1: Full update cycle**
```
User: "update daemon"
→ Aggregates PAI data sources
→ Applies security filter (deterministic)
→ Shows preview diff to user
→ User approves
→ Writes daemon-data.json to daemon-dm → deploys static site
```

**Example 2: Check what's current**
```
User: "check daemon"
→ Reads daemon-data.json from daemon-dm
→ Shows section-by-section status
```

**Example 3: Preview before committing**
```
User: "preview daemon"
→ Runs aggregator in preview mode
→ Shows diff against current daemon-data.json
→ No writes, no deploys
```

## Gotchas

- **Two repos:** Public framework (`~/Projects/daemon/`) and private content (`~/Projects/daemon-dm/`). The framework is forkable. The content is yours.
- **deploy.sh copies data into the framework at build time, then cleans up.** Personal data never gets committed to the public repo.
- **SecurityFilter is code, not prompts.** If you need to add new blocked patterns, edit SecurityFilter.ts, not the workflow markdown.
- **Site is fully static.** Data is embedded at build time. Changes require running `deploy.sh`.

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"Daemon","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```
