description: AI-powered audio and video editing pipeline: Whisper word-level transcription (insanely-fast-whisper on MPS) → Claude segment classification (KEEP / CUT_FILLER / CUT_FALSE_START / CUT_STUTTER / CUT_DEAD_AIR / CUT_EDIT_MARKER) → ffmpeg execution with 40ms qsin crossfades and room-tone gap fill → optional Cleanvoice API cloud polish for mouth sounds and loudness normalization. Distinguishes rhetorical pauses from accidental ones. Breaths attenuated to 50% volume (not removed). Preview mode (--preview flag) shows proposed cuts without modifying audio. Aggressive mode (--aggressive flag) applies tighter filler detection thresholds. Polish step (--polish flag) uploads to Cleanvoice API for mouth sound removal and loudness normalization — confirm before cloud upload of sensitive content. Pipeline tools: Transcribe.ts, Analyze.ts, Edit.ts, Polish.ts, Pipeline.ts. Single workflow: Clean.md. Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; CLEANVOICE_API_KEY optional for polish step.
