# AudioEditor

AI-powered audio/video editing — transcription, intelligent cut detection, automated editing with crossfades, and optional cloud polish.

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/AudioEditor/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.

## Voice Notification

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the AudioEditor skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **AudioEditor** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Clean** | "clean audio", "edit audio", "remove filler words", "clean podcast", "remove ums", "cut dead air", "polish audio" | `Workflows/Clean.md` |

## Pipeline Architecture

```
Audio Input
    |
[Transcribe] Whisper word-level timestamps (insanely-fast-whisper on MPS)
    |
[Analyze] Claude classifies each segment:
    |   KEEP / CUT_FILLER / CUT_FALSE_START / CUT_EDIT_MARKER / CUT_STUTTER / CUT_DEAD_AIR
    |   Distinguishes rhetorical emphasis from accidental repetition
    |
[Edit] ffmpeg executes cuts:
    |   - 40ms qsin crossfades at every edit point
    |   - Room tone extraction and gap filling
    |   - Breath attenuation (50% volume, not removal)
    |
[Polish] (optional) Cleanvoice API final pass:
        - Mouth sound removal
        - Remaining filler detection
        - Loudness normalization

Output: cleaned MP3/WAV
```

## Tools

| Tool | Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Transcribe** | `bun ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/Transcribe.ts <file>` | Word-level transcription via Whisper |
| **Analyze** | `bun ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/Analyze.ts <transcript.json>` | LLM-powered edit classification |
| **Edit** | `bun ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/Edit.ts <file> <edits.json>` | Execute cuts with crossfades + room tone |
| **Polish** | `bun ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/Polish.ts <file>` | Cleanvoice API cloud polish |
| **Pipeline** | `bun ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/Pipeline.ts <file> [--polish]` | Full end-to-end pipeline |

## API Keys Required

| Service | Env Var | Where to Get |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Anthropic (for analyze step) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Already set via Claude Code |
| Cleanvoice (for polish step, optional) | `CLEANVOICE_API_KEY` | cleanvoice.ai Dashboard Settings API Key |

## Examples

**Example 1: Clean a podcast recording**
```
User: "clean up the audio on this podcast file"
-> Invokes Clean workflow
-> Runs full pipeline: transcribe -> analyze -> edit
-> Outputs cleaned MP3 with filler words, stutters, and dead air removed
```

**Example 2: Preview edits before applying**
```
User: "show me what edits you'd make to this recording"
-> Invokes Clean workflow with --preview flag
-> Transcribes and analyzes, shows proposed edits without modifying audio
-> User reviews edit list, then runs again to apply
```

**Example 3: Aggressive clean with cloud polish**
```
User: "aggressively clean this audio and polish it"
-> Invokes Clean workflow with --aggressive --polish flags
-> Tighter thresholds for filler detection
-> Cleanvoice API pass for mouth sounds and normalization
```

## Gotchas

- **Transcription accuracy varies with audio quality.** Background noise, multiple speakers, and accents reduce accuracy.
- **Cut detection is heuristic-based.** Always preview edits before committing — automated cuts can remove intentional pauses.
- **Cloud polish uploads audio to external service.** Confirm the user is okay with cloud processing for sensitive content.

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"AudioEditor","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
