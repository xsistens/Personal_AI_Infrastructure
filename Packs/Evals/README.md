description: Comprehensive AI agent evaluation framework with three grader types (code-based: deterministic/fast; model-based: nuanced/LLM rubric; human: gold standard) and pass@k / pass^k scoring. Evaluates agent transcripts, tool-call sequences, and multi-turn conversations — not just single outputs. Supports capability evals (~70% pass target) and regression evals (~99% pass target). Workflows: RunEval, CompareModels, ComparePrompts, CreateJudge, CreateUseCase, RunScenario, CreateScenario, ViewResults. Integrates with THE ALGORITHM ISC rows for automated verification. Domain patterns pre-configured for coding, conversational, research, and computer-use agent types in Data/DomainPatterns.yaml. Tools: AlgorithmBridge.ts (ISC integration), FailureToTask.ts (failures → tasks), SuiteManager.ts (create/graduate/saturation-check), ScenarioRunner.ts (multi-turn simulated-user), TranscriptCapture.ts, PAIAgentAdapter.ts (wraps Inference.ts), ScenarioToTranscript.ts. Code-based graders: string_match, regex_match, binary_tests, static_analysis, state_check, tool_calls. Model-based graders: llm_rubric, natural_language_assert, pairwise_comparison.
