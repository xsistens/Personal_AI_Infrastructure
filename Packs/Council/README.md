description: Multi-agent collaborative debate that produces visible round-by-round transcripts with genuine intellectual friction. All council members are custom-composed via ComposeAgent (Agents skill) with domain expertise, unique voice, and personality tailored to the specific topic — never built-in generic types. ComposeAgent invoked as: bun run ~/.claude/skills/Agents/Tools/ComposeAgent.ts. Two workflows: DEBATE (3 rounds, full transcript + synthesis, parallel execution within rounds, 40-90 seconds total) and QUICK (1 round, fast perspective check). Context files: CouncilMembers.md (agent composition instructions), RoundStructure.md (three-round structure and timing), OutputFormat.md (transcript format templates). Agents are designed per debate topic to create real disagreement; 4-6 well-composed agents outperform 12 generic ones. Council is collaborative-adversarial (debate to find best path); for pure adversarial attack on an idea, use RedTeam instead.

# Council

Multi-agent collaborative debate that produces visible round-by-round transcripts with genuine intellectual friction. All council members are custom-composed via ComposeAgent (Agents skill) with domain expertise, unique voice, and personality tailored to the specific topic — never built-in generic types. ComposeAgent invoked as: bun run ~/.claude/skills/Agents/Tools/ComposeAgent.ts. Two workflows: DEBATE (3 rounds, full transcript + synthesis, parallel execution within rounds, 40-90 seconds total) and QUICK (1 round, fast perspective check). Context files: CouncilMembers.md (agent composition instructions), RoundStructure.md (three-round structure and timing), OutputFormat.md (transcript format templates). Agents are designed per debate topic to create real disagreement; 4-6 well-composed agents outperform 12 generic ones. Council is collaborative-adversarial (debate to find best path); for pure adversarial attack on an idea, use RedTeam instead.
