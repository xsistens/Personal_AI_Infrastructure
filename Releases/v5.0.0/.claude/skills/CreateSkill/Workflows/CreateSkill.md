# CreateSkill Workflow

Create a new skill following the canonical structure with proper TitleCase naming.

## Voice Notification

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Running the CreateSkill workflow in the CreateSkill skill to create new skill"}' \
  > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Running the **CreateSkill** workflow in the **CreateSkill** skill to create new skill...

## Step 1: Read the Authoritative Sources

**REQUIRED FIRST:**

1. Read the skill system documentation: `~/.claude/PAI/DOCUMENTATION/Skills/SkillSystem.md`
2. Read a canonical example skill — pick any existing public skill in `~/.claude/skills/` (e.g. `Research/SKILL.md`, `Daemon/SKILL.md`) and study its frontmatter, voice notification, workflow routing, and examples sections.

## Step 2: Understand the Request

Ask the user:
1. What does this skill do?
2. What should trigger it?
3. What workflows does it need?

## Step 2a: Identify Skill Type

Classify the skill using the 9 Anthropic skill types (see Skill Types table in SKILL.md):

| # | Type | Key Structural Pattern |
|---|------|----------------------|
| 1 | Library/API Reference | Gotchas-heavy, reference snippets |
| 2 | Product Validation | Browser/tmux, state assertions |
| 3 | Data Fetching | Credentials, query patterns |
| 4 | Business Process | Execution logs, consistency |
| 5 | Code Scaffolding | Templates, project-aware scripts |
| 6 | Code Quality | Deterministic scripts, hook integration |
| 7 | CI/CD & Deployment | Safety gates, rollback, smoke tests |
| 8 | Operations Runbook | Phenomenon → diagnosis → report |
| 9 | Infrastructure Ops | Safety guardrails, audit logging |

The type informs structure decisions — e.g., Type 1 skills are mostly gotchas, Type 7 needs safety gates.

## Step 2b: BPE Check

Before building, apply the bitter lesson test: **"Would a smarter model make this skill unnecessary?"**

- If the skill provides knowledge Claude can't derive (API quirks, org decisions) → **proceed**
- If the skill provides tools Claude can't replicate (API calls, automation) → **proceed**
- If the skill just orchestrates Claude's reasoning → **question whether it's needed**

## Step 3: Determine TitleCase Names

**All names must use TitleCase (PascalCase).**

| Component | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Skill directory | TitleCase | `Blogging`, `Daemon`, `CreateSkill` |
| Workflow files | TitleCase.md | `Create.md`, `UpdateDaemonInfo.md` |
| Reference docs | TitleCase.md | `ProsodyGuide.md`, `ApiReference.md` |
| Tool files | TitleCase.ts | `ManageServer.ts` |
| Help files | TitleCase.help.md | `ManageServer.help.md` |

**Wrong naming (NEVER use):**
- `create-skill`, `create_skill`, `CREATESKILL` → Use `CreateSkill`
- `create.md`, `CREATE.md`, `create-info.md` → Use `Create.md`, `CreateInfo.md`

## Step 4: Create the Skill Directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/[SkillName]/Workflows
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/[SkillName]/Tools
```

**Example:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/_DAEMON/Workflows
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/_DAEMON/Tools
```

## Step 5: Create SKILL.md

Follow this exact structure:

```yaml
---
name: SkillName
description: [What it does]. USE WHEN [intent triggers using OR]. NOT FOR [confusable alternatives]. [Additional capabilities].
---

# SkillName

[Brief description]

## Voice Notification

**When executing a workflow, do BOTH:**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running WORKFLOWNAME in SKILLNAME"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running **WorkflowName** in **SkillName**...
   ```

**Full documentation:** `~/.claude/PAI/DOCUMENTATION/Notifications/NotificationSystem.md`

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| **WorkflowOne** | "trigger phrase" | `Workflows/WorkflowOne.md` |
| **WorkflowTwo** | "another trigger" | `Workflows/WorkflowTwo.md` |

## Examples

**Example 1: [Common use case]**
```
User: "[Typical user request]"
→ Invokes WorkflowOne workflow
→ [What skill does]
→ [What user gets back]
```

**Example 2: [Another use case]**
```
User: "[Different request]"
→ [Process]
→ [Output]
```

## Gotchas

[Known failure modes, API quirks, common mistakes — accumulate over time]

## [Additional Documentation]

[Any other relevant info]
```

**For large skills (>500 lines):** Consider adding a `References/` subdirectory for detailed API docs, extensive examples, or troubleshooting guides. Keep SKILL.md as a routing guide.

## Step 5b: Public Release Readiness (MANDATORY)

**Every skill in `~/.claude/skills/` ships with the PAI public release.** Write generic from the start — do not rely on a scrub at release-time.

### Required

1. **No sensitive content** — no API keys, tokens, credentials, private URLs, auth secrets, private data
2. **No personal references** — no author name, no specific project names, no personal domains, no first-person war stories, no user-specific absolute paths like `/Users/<name>/...`
3. **Generic framing** — "someone reports a bug" over "<author-name> reports a bug"; "your web project" over "my UL site"; "a common root cause" over "the H3 root cause"

### Where Personal Context Belongs

User-specific preferences, project names, domain lists, and war stories go in `~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/<SkillName>/` — the skill body loads these at runtime via the Customization block. This keeps the public skill generic while each PAI user layers their own context.

### Pre-Flight Check

Before finalizing, grep the skill for personal refs:
```bash
rg -i "danielmiessler|unsupervised|ULAdmin|thesurface|human3|ul\.live|/Users/[a-z]+/" ~/.claude/skills/[SkillName]/
```

Zero matches = ready. Any match = replace with generic language or move to `SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/`.

## Step 6: Create Workflow Files

For each workflow in the routing section:

```bash
touch ~/.claude/skills/[SkillName]/Workflows/[WorkflowName].md
```

### Workflow-to-Tool Integration (REQUIRED for workflows with CLI tools)

**If a workflow calls a CLI tool, it MUST include intent-to-flag mapping tables.**

This pattern translates natural language user requests into appropriate CLI flags:

```markdown
## Intent-to-Flag Mapping

### Model/Mode Selection

| User Says | Flag | When to Use |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| "fast", "quick", "draft" | `--model haiku` | Speed priority |
| (default), "best", "high quality" | `--model opus` | Quality priority |

### Output Options

| User Says | Flag | Effect |
|-----------|------|--------|
| "JSON output" | `--format json` | Machine-readable |
| "detailed" | `--verbose` | Extra information |

## Execute Tool

Based on user request, construct the CLI command:

\`\`\`bash
bun ToolName.ts \
  [FLAGS_FROM_INTENT_MAPPING] \
  --required-param "value"
\`\`\`
```

**Why this matters:**
- Tools have rich configuration via flags
- Workflows should expose this flexibility, not hardcode single patterns
- Users speak naturally; workflows translate to precise CLI

**Reference:** `~/.claude/PAI/DOCUMENTATION/Tools/CliFirstArchitecture.md` (Workflow-to-Tool Integration section)

**Examples (TitleCase):**
```bash
touch ~/.claude/skills/MyDaemon/Workflows/UpdateDaemonInfo.md
touch ~/.claude/skills/MyDaemon/Workflows/UpdatePublicRepo.md
touch ~/.claude/skills/MyBlog/Workflows/Create.md
touch ~/.claude/skills/MyBlog/Workflows/Publish.md
```

## Step 7: Verify TitleCase

Run this check:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/[SkillName]/
ls ~/.claude/skills/[SkillName]/Workflows/
ls ~/.claude/skills/[SkillName]/Tools/
```

Verify ALL files use TitleCase:
- `SKILL.md` ✓ (exception - always uppercase)
- `WorkflowName.md` ✓
- `ToolName.ts` ✓
- `ToolName.help.md` ✓

## Step 9: Suggest Effectiveness Testing

After creating the skill, suggest to the user:

> "The skill structure is ready. Want me to **test it** to see if it actually improves outcomes? I can run it against real prompts and compare with a no-skill baseline using the TestSkill workflow."

If the user agrees, invoke `Workflows/TestSkill.md`.

If the description needs tuning, suggest `Workflows/OptimizeDescription.md`.

## Done

Skill created following canonical structure with proper TitleCase naming throughout.
