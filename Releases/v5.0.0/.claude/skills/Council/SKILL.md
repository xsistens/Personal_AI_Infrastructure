name: Council
description: "Multi-agent collaborative debate that produces visible round-by-round transcripts with genuine intellectual friction. All council members are custom-composed via ComposeAgent (Agents skill) with domain expertise, unique voice, and personality tailored to the specific topic — never built-in generic types. ComposeAgent invoked as: bun run ~/.claude/skills/Agents/Tools/ComposeAgent.ts. Two workflows: DEBATE (3 rounds, full transcript + synthesis, parallel execution within rounds, 40-90 seconds total) and QUICK (1 round, fast perspective check). Context files: CouncilMembers.md (agent composition instructions), RoundStructure.md (three-round structure and timing), OutputFormat.md (transcript format templates). Agents are designed per debate topic to create real disagreement; 4-6 well-composed agents outperform 12 generic ones. Council is collaborative-adversarial (debate to find best path); for pure adversarial attack on an idea, use RedTeam instead. NOT FOR parallel task execution across agents (use Delegation skill). USE WHEN council, debate, multiple perspectives, weigh options, deliberate, get different views, multi-agent discussion, what would experts say, is there consensus, pros and cons from multiple angles."

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Council/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.


## MANDATORY: Voice Notification (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY ACTION)

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the Council skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **Council** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

# Council Skill

Multi-agent debate system where custom-composed agents discuss topics in rounds, respond to each other's points, and surface insights through intellectual friction.

## CRITICAL: Custom Agents Only

**ALL council members MUST be custom-composed agents created via the Agents skill's ComposeAgent tool (`bun run ~/.claude/skills/Agents/Tools/ComposeAgent.ts`). NEVER use built-in agent types (Architect, Designer, Engineer, PerplexityResearcher, Silas, etc.).**

Built-in types are generic and topic-ignorant. Council debates require agents with:
- Domain expertise tailored to the specific debate topic
- Unique voices and personalities via ComposeAgent
- Distinct analytical approaches that create genuine friction

See `CouncilMembers.md` for full agent composition instructions.

**Key Differentiator from RedTeam:** Council is collaborative-adversarial (debate to find best path), while RedTeam is purely adversarial (attack the idea). Council produces visible conversation transcripts; RedTeam produces steelman + counter-argument.


## Workflow Routing

Route to the appropriate workflow based on the request.

| Trigger | Workflow |
|---------|----------|
| Full structured debate (3 rounds, visible transcript) | `Workflows/Debate.md` |
| Quick consensus check (1 round, fast) | `Workflows/Quick.md` |
| Pure adversarial analysis | RedTeam skill |

## Quick Reference

| Workflow | Purpose | Rounds | Output |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| **DEBATE** | Full structured discussion | 3 | Complete transcript + synthesis |
| **QUICK** | Fast perspective check | 1 | Initial positions only |

## Context Files

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `CouncilMembers.md` | How to compose custom agents for councils (ComposeAgent) |
| `RoundStructure.md` | Three-round debate structure and timing |
| `OutputFormat.md` | Transcript format templates |

## Core Philosophy

**Origin:** Best decisions emerge from diverse perspectives challenging each other. Not just collecting opinions - genuine intellectual friction where domain-specific experts respond to each other's actual points.

**Agents:** Every council uses custom-composed agents via the Agents skill. This gives each member a unique voice, personality, and domain expertise tailored to the topic. Generic built-in agents produce generic debate. Custom agents produce sharp, informed debate.

**Speed:** Parallel execution within rounds, sequential between rounds. A 3-round debate of 4 agents = 12 agent calls but only 3 sequential waits. Complete in 40-90 seconds.

## Examples

```
"Council: Should we use WebSockets or SSE?"
-> Compose 4 custom agents with relevant traits (real-time, frontend, ops, research)
-> DEBATE workflow -> 3-round transcript

"Quick council check: Is this API design reasonable?"
-> Compose 4 custom agents with API-relevant traits
-> QUICK workflow -> Fast perspectives

"Council: Is AI overhyped?"
-> Compose agents: AI builder, security skeptic, pragmatic engineer, evidence analyst
-> DEBATE workflow -> 3-round transcript
```

## Integration

**Depends on:**
- **Agents skill** - ComposeAgent tool for creating all council members

**Works well with:**
- **RedTeam** - Pure adversarial attack after collaborative discussion
- **Research** - Gather context before convening the council

## Best Practices

1. Use QUICK for sanity checks, DEBATE for important decisions
2. Design agent traits around the specific topic, not generic roles
3. Review the transcript - insights are in the responses, not just positions
4. Trust multi-agent convergence when it occurs
5. NEVER use built-in agent types — ALWAYS use ComposeAgent

## Gotchas

- **Council uses the Agents skill (ComposeAgent) for custom agents — NOT built-in agent types.** Never use Designer, Architect, etc. for Council debates.
- **Debates need genuine disagreement to be valuable.** If all agents agree, the topic may not warrant Council.
- **More agents ≠ better debate.** 4-6 well-composed agents outperform 12 generic ones.

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"Council","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
