# ApertureOscillation

**3-pass scope oscillation that varies the zoom level of how a question is framed — narrow tactical, wide strategic, then synthesis — to surface design tensions invisible at any single scope.**

Grounded in the observation that LLMs (and humans) produce fundamentally different outputs depending on the scope of the framing context. A component designed in isolation has its own logic. The same component designed within a stated system vision inherits different constraints. The delta between these two framings is where the real insight lives.

## Core Concept

Instead of rotating analytical lenses (IterativeDepth) or generating divergent ideas (BeCreative), ApertureOscillation holds the question constant but shifts the **scope envelope** around it across 3 structured passes:

1. **Narrow Aperture (Tactical-first):** The specific thing is primary. Big-picture context is background. This captures what the component naturally wants to be — its own internal logic and shape.

2. **Wide Aperture (Strategic-first):** The vision/system goal is primary. The specific thing is derived from it. This captures what the system needs the component to be — coherence, alignment, constraints you'd miss thinking locally.

3. **Oscillation (Synthesis):** Feed both outputs. Ask where the tactical and strategic views diverge. The tensions, gaps, and surprises between the two framings are the output — the things neither pass alone would surface.

## How It Differs from IterativeDepth

| Dimension | IterativeDepth | ApertureOscillation |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **What varies** | Analytical lens (failure, stakeholder, temporal...) | Scope/zoom level (narrow, wide, synthesized) |
| **Pass count** | 2-8 | 3 (fixed) |
| **Input** | Single problem statement | Two inputs: tactical target + strategic context |
| **Output** | Richer requirements from multiple angles | Design tensions between local and system-level views |
| **Best for** | Requirement discovery, blind spot elimination | Architecture decisions, feature design, system coherence |
| **When to combine** | Use IterativeDepth first (understand the problem), then ApertureOscillation (understand where the solution fits) |

## Use / Win

**When to use:** Any time you're building something specific within a larger system and need to ensure the local design serves the global vision — without losing the component's own logic.

Concrete triggers:
- **Architecture decisions** — "Should this be a service, a library, or inline?" depends entirely on whether you're zoomed into the component or zoomed out to the system.
- **Feature design** — The feature a user asks for vs. the feature the product needs are often subtly different. Oscillation surfaces the gap.
- **System coherence checks** — When adding to existing infrastructure, the new piece must serve both its own purpose and the system's. Single-scope framing misses one or the other.
- **Design reviews** — Before committing to an approach, oscillate scope to check that the tactical plan and the strategic vision agree.
- **Scope negotiation** — When the user says "build X" and X could be simple or complex depending on context, oscillation reveals which scope is appropriate.

**What you win:**
- **Design tensions surfaced before they become mid-build surprises.** The most expensive rework comes from a component that works perfectly on its own but doesn't serve the system.
- **Scope clarity.** Seeing the same question at narrow and wide aperture often reveals that the obvious scope is wrong.
- **Coherence confidence.** When tactical and strategic views align, you can build with conviction. When they diverge, you know exactly where to make tradeoffs.

## Workflow Routing

| Trigger | Workflow |
|---------|----------|
| "aperture oscillation", "oscillate scope", "zoom in/out", "tactical vs strategic" | `Workflows/Oscillate.md` |
| Algorithm OBSERVE/THINK selects ApertureOscillation capability | `Workflows/Oscillate.md` |

## Quick Reference

- **3 passes** — always 3 (narrow, wide, synthesis)
- **2 inputs** — tactical target (what you're building) + strategic context (why, the bigger picture)
- **Output** — design tensions, scope recommendations, coherence assessment
- **Integration point** — OBSERVE (before ISC) or THINK (before approach commitment)

## Gotchas

- **Requires two distinct inputs.** If the tactical target and strategic context are the same thing, ApertureOscillation adds no value — use IterativeDepth instead.
- **3 passes is the right number.** Unlike IterativeDepth (2-8), the narrow/wide/synthesis structure is complete at 3. Adding passes would just be lens rotation, which is IterativeDepth's job.
- **The synthesis pass is where the value lives.** Passes 1 and 2 are setup. If the synthesis finds no divergence, that's a valid (and valuable) finding — it means the tactical and strategic views are already aligned.
- **This is a BPE-fragile skill.** Monitor whether smarter models naturally oscillate scope without being prompted. Quarterly test recommended.

## Examples

**Example 1: Feature design within a system**
```
Tactical target: "Build a caching layer for session data"
Strategic context: "PAI is a Life OS that needs responsive, session-spanning AI assistance"

Pass 1 (Narrow): Redis with TTL, standard session cache patterns
Pass 2 (Wide): Cache must survive session boundaries, integrate with memory system, serve the Life OS vision
Pass 3 (Synthesis): Tension — standard session cache expires data that the Life OS needs to persist. Resolution: hybrid cache with session-scoped fast layer + memory-backed persistent layer.
```

**Example 2: Architecture decision**
```
Tactical target: "Add webhook support to the Feed system"
Strategic context: "Feed is one pipeline in Arbol, which processes content for Surface"

Pass 1 (Narrow): Standard webhook receiver, queue, retry logic
Pass 2 (Wide): Webhooks must flow through Arbol's action/function pattern, integrate with existing queue infrastructure
Pass 3 (Synthesis): Tension — standalone webhook service vs. Arbol action. Resolution: implement as Arbol action, not standalone service, because the strategic context demands pipeline coherence over component independence.
```

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"ApertureOscillation","workflow":"Oscillate","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
