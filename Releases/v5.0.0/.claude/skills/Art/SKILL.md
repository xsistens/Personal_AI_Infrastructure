# Art Skill

Complete visual content system for creating illustrations, diagrams, and visual content.

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Art/`

If this directory exists, load and apply:
- `PREFERENCES.md` - Aesthetic preferences, default model, output location
- `CharacterSpecs.md` - Character design specifications
- `SceneConstruction.md` - Scene composition guidelines

These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.


## 🚨 MANDATORY: Voice Notification (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY ACTION)

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the Art skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **Art** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

## 🚨🚨🚨 CONSTITUTIONAL: ALWAYS RUN A NAMED WORKFLOW. NEVER FREEFORM. 🚨🚨🚨

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  EVERY image generation MUST run through a named workflow       ⚠️
⚠️  in this skill's Workflows/ directory.                          ⚠️
⚠️  NEVER call Tools/Generate.ts with a hand-written prompt        ⚠️
⚠️  outside the workflow template — the workflows encode the       ⚠️
⚠️  quality standards (TECHNIQUE, palette, composition rules,      ⚠️
⚠️  problem-type metaphor, CSE-24 narrative arc) that the models   ⚠️
⚠️  consistently fail to honor without them.                       ⚠️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Freeform-prompting Generate.ts directly is FORBIDDEN.** It is the documented root cause of every "looks like shit" rejection in the rating history. The Essay / Frameworks / Maps / Comics / etc. workflows exist because the bare model defaults to illustrative-school cartoons; the workflow templates discipline it back to the editorial Lebbeus Woods / Paul Rudolph / charcoal-architectural register the principal actually wants.

**Routing rules — pick a workflow FIRST, before writing any prompt:**

| Request shape | Required workflow |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Blog header / editorial essay illustration | **`Workflows/Essay.md`** — Steps 1–8 in order, no skipping |
| Mermaid diagram | `Workflows/Mermaid.md` |
| Technical / architecture diagram | `Workflows/TechnicalDiagrams.md` |
| Framework / 2x2 / matrix | `Workflows/Frameworks.md` |
| D3 dashboard / chart | `Workflows/D3Dashboards.md` |
| Taxonomy / hierarchy | `Workflows/Taxonomies.md` |
| Timeline | `Workflows/Timelines.md` |
| Comparison | `Workflows/Comparisons.md` |
| Stat card | `Workflows/Stats.md` |
| Aphorism / quote card | `Workflows/Aphorisms.md` |
| Comic panel | `Workflows/Comics.md` |
| YouTube thumbnail | `Workflows/AdHocYouTubeThumbnail.md` or `Workflows/YouTubeThumbnailChecklist.md` |
| PAI pack icon | `Workflows/CreatePAIPackIcon.md` |
| brand-logo wallpaper | `Workflows/LogoWallpaper.md` |
| Recipe card | `Workflows/RecipeCards.md` |
| Map / conceptual map | `Workflows/Maps.md` |
| Annotated screenshot | `Workflows/AnnotatedScreenshots.md` |
| Background removal only | `Workflows/RemoveBackground.md` |
| Embossed logo wallpaper | `Workflows/EmbossedLogoWallpaper.md` |
| Generic visualization (none of the above fit) | `Workflows/Visualize.md` |

**The ONLY exception:** the user explicitly says "freeform" / "skip the workflow" / "just run Generate.ts directly with this prompt: ...". Without that explicit instruction, ALWAYS pick the matching workflow and execute its mandatory steps in order — including the prompt template, the technique block, the palette, the composition rules, and the validation gate.

If no workflow matches the request, **stop and surface to the user** before generating — propose either (a) the closest existing workflow, (b) using `Visualize.md` as the generic catch-all, or (c) creating a new workflow first via the `CreateSkill` skill. Do not improvise.

## 🚨🚨🚨 MANDATORY: Output to Downloads First 🚨🚨🚨

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  ALL GENERATED IMAGES GO TO ~/Downloads/ FIRST                   ⚠️
⚠️  NEVER output directly to project directories                    ⚠️
⚠️  User MUST preview in Finder/Preview before use                  ⚠️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**This applies to ALL workflows in this skill.**

## 🚨🚨🚨 MANDATORY: Transparency Rules for Blog Headers 🚨🚨🚨

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  INLINE (body) image → TRANSPARENT (PNG with alpha)           ⚠️
⚠️  SOCIAL THUMBNAIL (frontmatter) → SEPIA #EAE9DF (opaque)       ⚠️
⚠️  EVERY blog header MUST use --thumbnail (produces both)        ⚠️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The blog page background is sepia #EAE9DF. Inline images MUST be transparent PNG so they composite cleanly over the page. Social platforms (X, LinkedIn, RSS readers) do NOT honor transparency — they show white/black bleed-through — so the `thumbnail:` frontmatter MUST point to the sepia-backed version.

**Enforcement when calling `Generate.ts`:**
- `--thumbnail` is the ONLY correct flag for blog headers — it implicitly enables `--remove-bg` and produces BOTH `output.png` (transparent) AND `output-thumb.png` (#EAE9DF background).
- Background removal runs locally via `rembg` (no external API). If the model returns JPEG (Nano Banana Pro often does), `Generate.ts` automatically renames the output from `.jpg` → `.png` after rembg processing so the final transparent file is a real PNG with a real alpha channel. If you ever see a `.jpg` labeled "transparent", that is NOT transparent.
- If `rembg` isn't installed at `~/.local/bin/rembg`, the tool fails loudly with install instructions rather than silently producing an opaque image. Install: `pipx install rembg` (or set `REMBG_BIN` env var to override the path).

**Verification step before declaring an image done (REQUIRED):**
1. `file ~/Downloads/[name].png` → must report `PNG image data, ... RGBA` (8-bit/color RGBA). If it says `JPEG` or `8-bit colormap` without alpha, transparency failed.
2. `file ~/Downloads/[name]-thumb.png` → must report `PNG image data`. The thumb is intentionally opaque with sepia background.
3. Only after both pass: copy to the project directory and wire into the post.

**Wiring into the blog post:**
- Body inline: `[![Alt](/images/blog/[slug]/header.webp)](/images/blog/[slug]/header.webp)` — use the transparent WebP converted from the `.png`.
- Frontmatter: `thumbnail: https://example.com/images/blog/[slug]/header-thumb.png` — always the `-thumb.png` (opaque sepia).

Never reuse the opaque thumbnail for the inline slot. Never reuse the transparent file for the social thumbnail. These are two distinct outputs from one `--thumbnail` run.


## Workflow Routing

Route to the appropriate workflow based on the request.

  - Remove background from image → `Workflows/RemoveBackground.md`
  - brand-logo wallpaper with logo integration → `Workflows/LogoWallpaper.md`
  - YouTube thumbnail checklist → `Workflows/YouTubeThumbnailChecklist.md`
  - Blog header or editorial illustration → `Workflows/Essay.md`
  - D3.js interactive chart or dashboard → `Workflows/D3Dashboards.md`
  - Visualization or unsure which format → `Workflows/Visualize.md`
  - Mermaid flowchart or sequence diagram → `Workflows/Mermaid.md`
  - Technical or architecture diagram → `Workflows/TechnicalDiagrams.md`
  - Taxonomy or classification grid → `Workflows/Taxonomies.md`
  - Timeline or chronological progression → `Workflows/Timelines.md`
  - Framework or 2x2 matrix → `Workflows/Frameworks.md`
  - Comparison or X vs Y → `Workflows/Comparisons.md`
  - Annotated screenshot → `Workflows/AnnotatedScreenshots.md`
  - Recipe card or step-by-step → `Workflows/RecipeCards.md`
  - Aphorism or quote card → `Workflows/Aphorisms.md`
  - Conceptual map or territory → `Workflows/Maps.md`
  - Stat card or big number visual → `Workflows/Stats.md`
  - Comic or sequential panels → `Workflows/Comics.md`
  - YouTube thumbnail (with existing assets) → `Workflows/YouTubeThumbnailChecklist.md`
  - Ad-hoc YouTube thumbnail (generate from content) → `Workflows/AdHocYouTubeThumbnail.md`
  - PAI pack icon → `Workflows/CreatePAIPackIcon.md`

## Core Aesthetic

**Default:** Production-quality concept art style appropriate for editorial and technical content.

**User customization** defines specific aesthetic preferences including:
- Visual style and influences
- Line treatment and rendering approach
- Color palette and wash technique
- Character design specifications
- Scene composition rules

**Load from:** `~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Art/PREFERENCES.md`

---

## Reference Images

**User customization** may include reference images for consistent style.

Check `~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Art/PREFERENCES.md` for:
- Reference image locations
- Style examples by use case
- Character and scene reference guidance

**Usage:** Before generating images, load relevant user-provided references to match their preferred style.

---

## Image Generation

**Default model:** Check user customization at `SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Art/PREFERENCES.md`
**Fallback:** nano-banana-pro (Gemini 3 Pro)

### Model-Specific Size Requirements

Each model accepts different `--size` formats. Using the wrong format causes validation errors.

| Model | `--size` format | Valid values | Default |
|-------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| `flux` | Aspect ratio | `1:1`, `16:9`, `3:2`, `2:3`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `4:5`, `5:4`, `9:16`, `21:9` | `16:9` |
| `nano-banana` | Aspect ratio | `1:1`, `16:9`, `3:2`, `2:3`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `4:5`, `5:4`, `9:16`, `21:9` | `16:9` |
| `nano-banana-pro` | Resolution tier | `1K`, `2K`, `4K` (also accepts `--aspect-ratio` separately) | `2K` |
| `gpt-image-2` (current) / `gpt-image-1.5` (fallback) | Pixel dimensions | `1024x1024`, `1536x1024`, `1024x1536`, `2048x2048`, `auto` | NOTE: `gpt-image-1` is **deprecated** per OpenAI docs — do not use. | `1024x1024` |

**Note:** `nano-banana-pro` uses `--size` for resolution quality and a separate `--aspect-ratio` flag for aspect ratio (defaults to `16:9`).

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Always Output to Downloads First

**ALL generated images MUST go to `~/Downloads/` first for preview and selection.**

Never output directly to a project's `public/images/` directory. User needs to review images in Preview before they're used.

**Workflow:**
1. Generate to `~/Downloads/[descriptive-name].png`
2. User reviews in Preview
3. If approved, THEN copy to final destination (e.g., `cms/public/images/`)
4. Create WebP and thumbnail versions at final destination

```bash
# CORRECT - Output to Downloads for preview
bun run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --thumbnail \
  --output ~/Downloads/blog-header-concept.png

# After approval, copy to final location
cp ~/Downloads/blog-header-concept.png ~/LocalProjects/Website/cms/public/images/
cp ~/Downloads/blog-header-concept-thumb.png ~/LocalProjects/Website/cms/public/images/
```

### Multiple Reference Images (Character/Style Consistency)

For improved character or style consistency, use multiple `--reference-image` flags:

```bash
# Multiple reference images for better likeness
bun run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "Person from references at a party..." \
  --reference-image face1.jpg \
  --reference-image face2.jpg \
  --reference-image face3.jpg \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  --output ~/Downloads/character-scene.png
```

**API Limits (Gemini):**
- Up to 5 human reference images
- Up to 6 object reference images
- Maximum 14 total reference images per request

**API keys in:** `${PAI_DIR}/.env`

## Examples

**Example 1: Blog header image**
```
User: "create a header for my AI agents post"
→ Invokes ESSAY workflow
→ Generates charcoal sketch prompt
→ Creates image with architectural aesthetic
→ Saves to ~/Downloads/ for preview
→ After approval, copies to public/images/
```

**Example 2: Technical architecture diagram**
```
User: "make a diagram showing the SPQA pattern"
→ Invokes TECHNICALDIAGRAMS workflow
→ Creates structured architecture visual
→ Outputs PNG with consistent styling
```

**Example 3: Comparison visualization**
```
User: "visualize humans vs AI decision-making"
→ Invokes COMPARISONS workflow
→ Creates side-by-side visual
→ Charcoal sketch with labeled elements
```

**Example 4: PAI pack icon**
```
User: "create icon for the skill system pack"
→ Invokes CREATEPAIPACKICON workflow
→ Reads workflow from Workflows/CreatePAIPackIcon.md
→ Generates 1K image with --remove-bg for transparency
→ Resizes to 256x256 RGBA PNG
→ Outputs to ~/Downloads/ for preview
→ After approval, copies to ${PROJECTS_DIR}/PAI/Packs/icons/
```

## Gotchas

- **Always output to ~/Downloads/ first — NEVER directly to project directories.** User must preview before use. Multiple past failures from pushing wrong images directly to repos.
- **Verify image dimensions match target use case before claiming done.** Social media previews, blog headers, and thumbnails have different size requirements. A header that works on the blog may break OG/social previews.
- **nano-banana-pro uses `--size` for resolution (1K/2K/4K) and SEPARATE `--aspect-ratio` flag.** Don't pass aspect ratio values to `--size`.
- **Reference images: max 5 human, 6 object, 14 total per request** (Gemini API limit).
- **After generating, use Read tool to visually confirm the image before reporting success.** "Generated successfully" means nothing if you haven't looked at it.
- **When asked to use a specific image URL or file, use EXACTLY that asset.** Don't substitute similar images. Past rating-1 failures from using wrong image assets.
- **`--remove-bg` may produce black backgrounds instead of transparency.** Always verify transparent PNG output visually before deploying.

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"Art","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
