Running **SpawnTeam** in **Agents** to launch the **TEAM_NAME** team...

---

## When to Use

{PRINCIPAL.NAME} says:
- "Engineering team: refactor the auth module"
- "Get the security team on the new API"
- "Architecture team — design the feed system"
- "Marketing team, plan the launch"
- "Just the QA lead and senior engineer on this"

**KEY TRIGGER: "[team name] team" followed by a task = predefined specialist team.**

## Available Teams

| Team | Domain | Members | Config |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Engineering** | Building, shipping code | Senior Engineer, QA Lead, Performance Engineer, DevOps | `Data/Teams/engineering.yaml` |
| **Architecture** | System design, tech decisions | Systems Architect, Infrastructure Architect, API Designer, Data Architect | `Data/Teams/architecture.yaml` |

| **Strategy** | Business decisions, planning | Strategist, Operator, Financial Analyst, Risk Assessor, Contrarian | `Data/Teams/strategy.yaml` |

## The Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Team & Task

Parse {PRINCIPAL.NAME}'s request:
- Which team? (Match by name or domain)
- What's the task? (The work to be done)
- Subset? (Specific members requested, or full team)
- Model preference? (Default: sonnet for most, opus for architecture/strategy)

### Step 2: Load Team Config

Read the team's YAML config from `~/.claude/skills/Agents/Data/Teams/{team}.yaml`:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/Agents/Data/Teams/engineering.yaml
```

Extract:
- Member definitions (role, traits, focus, bias, objective, evidence standards, red lines)
- Tension pairs
- Expertise path

### Step 3: Load Expertise (if exists)

Check if the team has accumulated expertise:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/TEAMS/{team}/expertise.md
```

If it exists, include relevant past context in each member's prompt. This is what makes teams better over time.

### Step 4: Compose Each Member via ComposeAgent

For each team member (or requested subset), run ComposeAgent:

```bash
# Example for Engineering team's QA Lead
bun run ~/.claude/skills/Agents/Tools/ComposeAgent.ts \
  --traits "technical,skeptical,thorough" \
  --task "QA review of auth module refactor" \
  --output json
```

### Step 5: Enhance Prompts with Team Context

Append to each member's ComposeAgent prompt:

```markdown
## Team Role: {role}

You are the **{role}** on the **{team name}**.

**Your focus:** {focus}
**Your bias:** {bias}
**Your objective:** {objective}
**Your time horizon:** {time_horizon}

**Evidence standards:**
- Convinced by: {convinced_by}
- Not convinced by: {not_convinced_by}

**Red lines (you will not cross these):**
{red_lines}

**Tension partners:** You are in productive tension with {tension_partner}
about {tension_description}. This tension improves the team's output.

## The Task
{task_description}

## Team Expertise (from prior sessions)
{expertise_content or "First session — no prior expertise."}

## Instructions
1. Do your part of the work from your role's perspective
2. Be specific about what you'd approve, flag, or block
3. Reference your evidence standards when making claims
4. Note any tension with other roles' likely positions
5. Deliver concrete output, not just opinions
```

### Step 6: Launch All Members in Parallel

**CRITICAL: Single message, multiple Task calls for parallel execution.**

```typescript
// All team members launch simultaneously:
Task({
  description: "Engineering: Senior Engineer - auth refactor",
  prompt: <senior_engineer_enhanced_prompt>,
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "sonnet",
  run_in_background: true
})
Task({
  description: "Engineering: QA Lead - auth refactor",
  prompt: <qa_lead_enhanced_prompt>,
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "sonnet",
  run_in_background: true
})
// ... remaining members
```

### Step 7: Coordinate & Synthesize

After all members return:

1. **Collect outputs** — Read each member's response
2. **Identify tensions** — Where do members disagree? (This is the valuable part)
3. **Resolve or document** — If tensions can be resolved, resolve them. If not, document both sides.
4. **Synthesize** — Combine into a unified deliverable:
   - What the team agrees on
   - Where tensions exist and why
   - Concrete recommendations
   - Red line violations flagged by any member
5. **Deliver** — Present the unified output to {PRINCIPAL.NAME}

### Step 8: Update Expertise (Optional)

If the session produced valuable patterns, update the team's expertise file:

```bash
# Append new learnings
echo "## Session: YYYY-MM-DD - {task summary}
- Key decision: {what was decided}
- Tension resolved: {which tension, how}
- Pattern noted: {reusable insight}
" >> ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/TEAMS/{team}/expertise.md
```

## Subset Selection

When {PRINCIPAL.NAME} requests specific members:

```
"Just the QA lead and senior engineer on this"
→ Filter to only those 2 members from engineering.yaml

"Security team but skip compliance — this is internal only"
→ Load security.yaml, exclude Compliance Analyst

"Architecture team, just the API and data architects"
→ Filter to API Designer + Data Architect only
```

Parse member names case-insensitively. Match on role name or reasonable abbreviation.

## Model Selection

| Team | Default Model | Reasoning |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| Engineering | sonnet | Balanced speed/quality for code work |
| Architecture | opus | Deep reasoning for system design |
| Marketing | sonnet | Creative + analytical balance |
| Design | sonnet | Creative work, fast iteration |
| Security | sonnet | Technical analysis, good enough for most |
| Research | sonnet | Research speed, upgrade to opus for deep dives |
| Content | sonnet | Writing quality, fast turnaround |
| Strategy | opus | Complex multi-factor decisions |

Override with: "Use opus for the engineering team on this" or "haiku is fine for this research."

## Example Executions

### Example 1: Engineering Team

**{PRINCIPAL.NAME}:** "Engineering team: refactor the auth module in the feed system"

**Execution:**
1. Load `engineering.yaml` — 4 members
2. Load expertise from `~/.claude/`
3. Compose each: Senior Engineer (technical,pragmatic,systematic), QA Lead (technical,skeptical,thorough), Performance Engineer (technical,analytical,systematic), DevOps (technical,cautious,consultative)
4. Enhance prompts with role context + task
5. Launch 4 agents in parallel on sonnet
6. Collect: Senior Engineer's refactor plan, QA Lead's test concerns, Performance Engineer's hotspot analysis, DevOps' deploy considerations
7. Synthesize: Unified refactor plan with test coverage requirements, performance benchmarks, and deploy strategy
8. Deliver

### Example 2: Security Team (Subset)

**{PRINCIPAL.NAME}:** "Just the threat modeler and red teamer on the new API endpoints"

**Execution:**
1. Load `security.yaml` — filter to Threat Modeler + Red Teamer only
2. Compose 2 agents with their respective traits
3. Launch in parallel
4. Collect: Threat model + attempted exploitation findings
5. Synthesize: Combined threat assessment
6. Deliver

### Example 3: Strategy Team

**{PRINCIPAL.NAME}:** "Strategy team: should I accept the conference speaking offer?"

**Execution:**
1. Load `strategy.yaml` — 5 members
2. Ask for structured brief if not provided (Situation/Stakes/Constraints/Key Question)
3. Compose all 5 with enhanced role prompts
4. Launch on opus (strategy decisions need deep reasoning)
5. Collect positions from all 5, noting Contrarian's challenge to consensus
6. Synthesize: Ranked recommendation with dissent documented
7. Deliver

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Wrong: Composing team members without role context**
```bash
# Just traits, no team role enhancement
bun run ComposeAgent.ts --traits "technical,skeptical,thorough"
# Missing: focus, bias, objective, evidence standards, red lines, tensions
```

**Right: Enhance with full team context**
```bash
# Compose base, then append team role section
bun run ComposeAgent.ts --traits "technical,skeptical,thorough" --output json
# Then add ## Team Role section with all YAML-defined attributes
```

**Wrong: Sequential member execution**
```typescript
await Task({ ... }) // Member 1 (blocks)
await Task({ ... }) // Member 2 (waits)
```

**Right: Parallel execution**
```typescript
// Single message, all members simultaneously
Task({ ... }) // Member 1
Task({ ... }) // Member 2
Task({ ... }) // Member 3
```
