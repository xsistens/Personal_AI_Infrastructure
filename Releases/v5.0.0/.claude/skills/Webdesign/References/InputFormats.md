# Input Formats

How to prepare briefs, reference materials, and codebases so Claude Design produces the best output on the first pass.

## The Ideal Brief

An effective Claude Design brief has five parts:

1. **Purpose** — what the interface does, who uses it (1 sentence)
2. **Aesthetic direction** — ONE committed choice from the catalog (brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, editorial, retro-futuristic, etc.)
3. **Constraints** — framework, responsive tier, a11y tier, dark-mode, specific elements required
4. **Differentiation** — the one memorable detail that makes this not-generic
5. **Scope** — sections, key components, must-haves / must-nots

### Template

```
PURPOSE: A [thing] for [audience] that helps them [core job].

AESTHETIC: [one direction — brutalist / editorial / retro-futuristic / minimal / etc.]
Rationale: [why this fits the audience and job]

CONSTRAINTS:
- Framework: [next / astro / vitepress / react-vite / vanilla]
- Responsive: mobile-first, breakpoints at 640/768/1024/1280
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA
- Dark mode: [yes / no / both]
- Typography: [pair or "your choice"]

DIFFERENTIATION: [the one memorable element]

SCOPE:
- Section 1: [purpose, key content]
- Section 2: [purpose, key content]
- Must-haves: [list]
- Must-NOTs: [list]
```

## Aesthetic Catalog

Use these as starting points, not final prescriptions. Blending two is fine; picking three guarantees muddled output.

| Direction | Feels like | Works for |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Brutally minimal** | Raw, unstyled, type-led | Personal sites, essays, manifestos |
| **Maximalist chaos** | Layered, dense, texture-heavy | Music, fashion, indie games |
| **Retro-futuristic** | 70s-80s computer-mag energy | Dev tools, infra companies |
| **Editorial / magazine** | Big photography, grid-breaking | Publications, longform content |
| **Brutalist / raw** | Concrete textures, stark lines | Indie software, art sites |
| **Art deco / geometric** | Symmetry, gold, ornamentation | Luxury, finance, legal |
| **Soft / pastel** | Rounded, warm, approachable | Wellness, health, kids |
| **Industrial / utilitarian** | Dense info, mono fonts, sharp | Dashboards, admin tools |
| **Playful / toy-like** | Cartoon, bouncy, vibrant | Consumer apps, games |
| **Luxury / refined** | Generous space, muted palette, serif | High-end brands, services |
| **Editorial newspaper** | Serif-led, columnar, dated | Journalism, thinkfluencer |
| **Poster / swiss-modernist** | Big type, grids, no ornament | Agencies, portfolios |

### Avoid Generic Defaults

Claude Design (like any model) defaults to generic when the brief is vague. Explicit directions block:

- ❌ Inter / Roboto / Arial / system-ui-only
- ❌ Purple gradients on white
- ❌ Space Grotesk (overused)
- ❌ Identical card-grid layouts
- ❌ Timid, evenly-distributed color palettes

Request:

- ✅ Distinctive display + body font pair (name both)
- ✅ Dominant color + sharp accents (specify hex or named)
- ✅ Asymmetric or grid-breaking layout
- ✅ One orchestrated animation moment (not scattered micro-interactions)

## Reference Images

Feeding 1-5 reference images dramatically lifts first-pass quality. Best practices:

- **Mood over copy** — reference the vibe, not the content. "This kind of gridded editorial feel" not "copy this site."
- **Mix sources** — one website screenshot + one poster + one architecture photo produces richer outputs than three website screenshots.
- **Label each image** — "ref-1-type.png is for typography; ref-2-color.png is for palette; ref-3-layout.png is for composition."
- **Avoid AI-generated references** — they amplify the generic. Use real human-designed sources.

## Codebase Preparation (for design-system extraction)

Before feeding a codebase to `ExtractDesignSystem`:

1. **Curate** — don't upload the whole repo. Pull 20-50 focused files.
2. **Include** — `tailwind.config.*`, `src/styles/`, `src/components/ui/`, primary layout components, `package.json`.
3. **Exclude** — `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `public/` (unless it has brand assets), test files.
4. **Include brand** — logos (SVG preferred), custom font files, any brand guide PDF.
5. **Flag ambiguity** — if the codebase has two incompatible button styles or three competing color palettes, tell Claude Design upfront ("the codebase is mid-migration; prefer the newer `*.v2.*` files").

## Prompt Length Sweet Spot

- **Too short** (<50 words) — generic output, defaults everywhere
- **Sweet spot** (100-300 words) — directed output, most detail filled
- **Too long** (>500 words) — Claude Design starts ignoring parts of the brief

If a brief starts exceeding 300 words, split into phases: first brief for prototype, follow-up refinements for details.

## Iteration vs Restart

| Situation | What to do |
|-----------|-----------|
| Prototype is 80% right, small fixes needed | `RefinePrototype` with specific adjustments |
| Aesthetic is wrong | Restart with a sharper aesthetic direction |
| Structure is wrong (missing sections, wrong flow) | Restart with a fuller scope section in the brief |
| "Just not loving it" | Restart — the brief was underspecified; don't refine your way to the right answer |

## Examples of Effective Briefs

### Brief 1 — Brutalist portfolio

> PURPOSE: A single-page portfolio for a print-focused graphic designer.
> AESTHETIC: Brutalist. Raw, unstyled, type-led. Think early Ray Gun magazine.
> CONSTRAINTS: Framework astro, mobile-first, a11y AA, dark-only, serif display + mono body (no sans).
> DIFFERENTIATION: Oversized page number bleeding off the left edge of every section.
> SCOPE: Hero with name + date, 8 work samples in irregular asymmetric grid, contact strip at bottom. No nav, no footer, no social icons.

### Brief 2 — Minimalist SaaS dashboard

> PURPOSE: An admin dashboard for content moderators on a social platform. They review 50-200 items per shift.
> AESTHETIC: Industrial minimal. Dense information, mono for data, sans for chrome.
> CONSTRAINTS: React+Vite+shadcn, desktop-first (1440+ primary), AA contrast, dark default with light toggle, IBM Plex Sans + Plex Mono.
> DIFFERENTIATION: A unified command palette (⌘K) that's visible on first load for 2 seconds, then minimizes — guides users to the keyboard-first workflow.
> SCOPE: Item queue (list + detail split view), filters sidebar, action toolbar, keyboard shortcut legend. No marketing content, no avatars, no "welcome back" chrome.
