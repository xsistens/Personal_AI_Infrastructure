## ✨ Discoveries

Everything interesting we found, ranked by how cool it is.

| # | Discovery | Source | Why It's Interesting | PAI Relevance |
|---|-----------|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1 | PreToolUse hooks can inject reasoning context | claude-code v2.1.16 | Hooks can now return `additionalContext` that Claude reasons about before tool execution — this is a paradigm shift from binary block/allow to intelligent security | SecurityValidator could inject warnings instead of blocking, enabling context-aware security decisions |
| 2 | Native ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} variable | claude-code v2.1.16 | Session IDs are now first-class environment variables everywhere — no more extraction hacks | Session documentation workflows can drop manual ID extraction code |
| 3 | MCP auto mode enabled by default | claude-code v2.1.16 | MCP servers now auto-connect without explicit configuration | Already enabled — no action needed |

## 🔥 Recommendations

### 🔴 CRITICAL — Integrate immediately

| # | Recommendation | Prior Status | Evidence | PAI Relevance | Effort | Files Affected |
|---|---------------|-------------|----------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Add PreToolUse additionalContext to security hooks | 🆕 NEW | `hooks/SecurityPipeline.hook.ts:42` returns binary deny/allow only | SecurityValidator currently hard-blocks commands — additionalContext enables reasoning-based security that adapts to context | Low | `hooks/SecurityValidator.hook.ts` |

### 🟠 HIGH — Integrate this week

| # | Recommendation | Prior Status | Evidence | PAI Relevance | Effort | Files Affected |
|---|---------------|-------------|----------|---------------|--------|----------------|
| 2 | Replace session ID hacks with native ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} | 🔶 PARTIAL | `skills/_PAI/Workflows/DocumentSession.md:15` uses extraction hack | Session documentation workflows have manual extraction workarounds — native variable eliminates fragile code | Low | `skills/_PAI/Workflows/DocumentSession.md` |

## 🎯 Technique Details

### From Release Notes

#### 1. PreToolUse Additional Context
**Source:** GitHub claude-code v2.1.16
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

**What It Is:** PreToolUse hooks can now return an additionalContext field that gets injected into the model's context before tool execution, enabling reasoning-based security rather than hard blocks.

**How It Helps PAI:** SecurityValidator.hook.ts currently blocks dangerous commands. With additionalContext, it can inject warnings Claude reasons about, enabling smarter security that adapts to context.

**The Technique:**
```typescript
return { decision: "allow", additionalContext: "WARNING: Protected file." };
```

**Applies To:** `hooks/SecurityValidator.hook.ts`

---

#### 2. Session ID Substitution
**Source:** GitHub claude-code v2.1.16
**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH

**What It Is:** Native environment variable ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} is now available in all hooks and commands, eliminating the need for custom session ID extraction or workaround code.

**How It Helps PAI:** Our session documentation workflows had manual session ID extraction hacks. Native substitution means cleaner code and reliable session tracking across all PAI workflows.

**The Technique:**
```bash
echo "Session: ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"
```

**Applies To:** `skills/_PAI/Workflows/DocumentSession.md`
