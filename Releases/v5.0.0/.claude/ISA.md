## Problem

Most people have AI in tabs and chat windows — a tool you visit, ask things of, and leave. The interface treats AI like a search box that talks back. That framing wastes the most important capability of modern models: AI that knows your goals, your projects, your constraints, your relationships, and the state of your work in progress, so that any task — from "draft this email" to "redesign this whole system" — happens against the full context of your life rather than from a cold start every time. Without that context, every interaction is shallower than it could be, every prompt has to re-explain who you are, and the compounding value of an AI that genuinely knows you never accrues. The market is full of AI products. Almost none of them are infrastructure for *your* life.

## Vision

PAI is the Life Operating System — scaffolding that turns AI from a chatbot you talk to into a system that helps you run your life. The dashboard at `localhost:31337` (Pulse) shows what you're working on, what's next, what's stuck, what your DA is doing for you while you sleep. The Algorithm is the universal engine for accomplishing any task at any scale — fixing a typo, building a feature, launching a company — by transitioning current state to ideal state through verifiable iteration. The DA ({{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}'s is {{DA_NAME}}) is the primary interface — peer, not assistant — speaking in first person, with personality and opinions, capable of both deep work and casual conversation. The Memory system compounds across sessions: WORK → LEARNING → KNOWLEDGE. Skills are self-activating composable domain units. Hooks integrate the SessionStart→SessionEnd lifecycle. The whole thing is open-source and template-able — every PAI user names their own DA, fills in their own TELOS, and gets a Life OS built on the same framework {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} runs. Euphoric surprise: a new user installs PAI, configures it in an afternoon, and within a week catches themselves talking to their DA the way {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} talks to {{DA_NAME}} — peer, builder, friend.

## Out of Scope

- **Multi-tenant SaaS.** PAI is for individual use. Each human installs it for themselves; one human, one Anthropic subscription, one PAI instance. The Personal Use Boundary in the system prompt is non-negotiable.
- **Cloud-hosted DA.** The Life OS runs on the user's machine and the user's accounts. Pulse is `localhost:31337`, not a SaaS.
- **Mass-market consumer onboarding.** PAI targets technically capable users (developers, operators, power users). The maturity model targets AS3 — Augmented Self level 3 — not "everyone."
- **Company-grade MDM/RBAC for the OS itself.** PAI is single-user infrastructure; team / enterprise versions are a separate downstream concern, not v6.x.
- **A model competitor.** PAI is scaffolding. The model is Claude (and any other model the user wires in). The principle is **Scaffolding > Model** — the framework wins by making any underlying model dependable and contextual, not by replacing it.

## Principles

- **PAI is the Life OS.** Every subsystem feeds the user's transition from current state to ideal state.
- **The Algorithm is the centerpiece.** Every task, no matter the domain, runs through the same seven-phase loop with verifiable iteration.
- **Scaffolding over Model.** Capability comes from the framework, not from waiting for the next model.
- **Code Before Prompts.** Deterministic TypeScript wins over instructions whenever a deterministic implementation is possible.
- **CLI as Interface.** Every capability is invocable as a CLI; prompts wrap CLIs, agents wrap prompts.
- **As Deterministic as Possible.** Hooks, settings, and skills run as code. The model handles judgment; the system handles enforcement.
- **The ISA is the system of record.** No parallel acceptance.yaml, no separate test specs — the ISA carries the ideal state, the test harness, the build verification, the done condition, and the artifact's history.
- **Self-Healing Infrastructure.** When a rule is missed, fix the system, not your notes. Patch CLAUDE.md, the hook, the skill — never accumulate sticky-note memos against an OS-level bug.
- **Permission to Fail.** Failed runs and dead ends are first-class artifacts; the Decisions section preserves them so future sessions don't re-explore them.

## Constraints

- **Personal Use Boundary.** One human per PAI instance. OAuth/keychain billing reserved for {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}; channels that respond to other humans must use API keys explicitly.
- **`~/.claude` is PRIVATE forever.** No public push, no copy into public repos, no paste into web tools, no quoting absolute paths in public-destined output. The `<your-release-skill>` skill release workflow is the only sanctioned path to public visibility.
- **Bun and TypeScript only.** Never npm/npx. Never Python without explicit approval.
- **Markdown over HTML and XML.** Markdown headers structure prompts; XML tags are forbidden in instruction files.
- **Verification over claims.** "Should work" is forbidden. Every assertion requires tool-based evidence. Browser changes verify through Interceptor.
- **No `claude --bare` in subprocesses.** Subprocess invocations mirror `Tools/Inference.ts` flag pattern and scrub `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` to keep OAuth billing.
- **Hard-to-vary explanations.** Every ISC must name a single binary tool probe; vague criteria fail the granularity rule.

## Goal

PAI ships as an open-source, template-able Personal AI Infrastructure where the Algorithm (currently v6.2.0) is the universal task engine, the ISA (currently format spec v2.7) is the system of record for any thing being built, the Memory system compounds across sessions, the DA is a peer-grade primary interface, and the whole framework is configurable per-user via `USER/` while remaining structurally identical across installs. Done state for the project: any new user who runs the public release can install it, scaffold their own TELOS, name their own DA, and have a working Life OS within an afternoon — and the Algorithm version progression (v3 → v4 → v5 → v6 → onward) demonstrably improves the doctrine each release without losing prior invariants.

## Criteria

(Project ISA at the meta level — the ISCs below are for the **PAI framework itself**. Project sub-ISAs and task ISAs cover application-level work.)

### Algorithm core

- [x] ISC-1: `~/.claude/PAI/ALGORITHM/LATEST` reads the current version (today: `6.2.0`).
- [x] ISC-2: `~/.claude/PAI/ALGORITHM/v6.2.0.md` exists and is the doctrine spec linked from `LATEST`.
- [x] ISC-3: The seven phases (OBSERVE / THINK / PLAN / BUILD / EXECUTE / VERIFY / LEARN) are present in the active spec with mandatory phase headers.
- [x] ISC-4: Voice announcements at Algorithm entry and every phase transition (`fTtv3eikoepIosk8dTZ5` voice ID).
- [x] ISC-5: `EscalationGate.hook.ts` (UserPromptSubmit) writes `MODE_FLOOR` to additionalContext on doctrine-affecting / architectural-locator / multi-project / soft-user-signal / hard-to-vary triggers.
- [x] ISC-6: Thinking-floor at E2+ is HARD (E2 ≥2, E3 ≥4, E4 ≥6, E5 ≥8) and cannot be relaxed via show-your-math.
- [x] ISC-7: Cato cross-vendor audit is MANDATORY at E4/E5 in VERIFY.

### ISA primitive

- [x] ISC-8: ISA body has twelve sections in fixed order (Problem / Vision / Out of Scope / Principles / Constraints / Goal / Criteria / Test Strategy / Features / Decisions / Changelog / Verification).
- [x] ISC-9: Three-guardrail taxonomy is documented (Principles bind thinking, Constraints bind solution space, Out of Scope binds vision, Anti-criteria bind test surface).
- [x] ISC-10: Tier Completeness Gate is HARD at every tier with the E1→E5 ramp.
- [x] ISC-11: ID-stability rule prevents ISC renumbering on edit; splits become ISC-N.M; drops are tombstoned.
- [x] ISC-12: ISA Skill at `~/.claude/skills/ISA/` owns six workflows (Scaffold / Interview / CheckCompleteness / Reconcile / Seed / Append) and four examples (canonical-isa / e1-minimal / e3-project / e5-comprehensive).
- [x] ISC-13: Append workflow gates the Deutsch conjecture/refutation/learning Changelog format and refuses partial entries.

### Memory system

- [x] ISC-14: `MEMORY/WORK/{slug}/ISA.md` is the canonical task ISA path.
- [x] ISC-15: `<project>/ISA.md` is the canonical project ISA path.
- [x] ISC-16: `MEMORY/KNOWLEDGE/` typed graph (People / Companies / Ideas / Research) is queried at THINK and written at LEARN.
- [x] ISC-17: Memory v7.6 documented in `PAI/DOCUMENTATION/Memory/MemorySystem.md`.

### DA / Pulse

- [x] ISC-18: {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}'s DA `{{DA_FULL_NAME}}` is configured at `USER/DA_IDENTITY.md`; voice, personality, autonomy boundaries, companion ({{PRINCIPAL_COMPANION_NAME}}), and partner (Devi) are documented.
- [x] ISC-19: Pulse runs at `localhost:31337` and serves the Life Dashboard UI.

### Hooks / Security

- [x] ISC-20: `SecurityPipeline.hook.ts` runs on every subagent tool call and primary tool call.
- [x] ISC-21: External content is treated as READ-ONLY data; prompt injection is reported to {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} and refused.
- [x] ISC-22: `ContainmentGuard` hook blocks hardcoded `~/.claude` paths from reaching public-destined files.

### Public release surface

- [x] ISC-23: `<your-release-skill>` skill `CreateShadowRelease` workflow is the only sanctioned path from `~/.claude` to public visibility.
- [ ] ISC-24: Public PAI repo (`danielmiessler/PAI`) reflects the v6.2.0 frame after the next shadow release runs.

### Anti-criteria

- [x] ISC-25: Anti: out of scope — no multi-tenant SaaS code path exists in `~/.claude` (out of scope: "Multi-tenant SaaS").
- [x] ISC-26: Anti: out of scope — no cloud-hosted DA endpoint serves the OS (Pulse stays on `localhost:31337`).
- [x] ISC-27: Anti: regression — `~/.claude` repo never pushes to a public remote (constitutional rule in system prompt).
- [x] ISC-28: Anti: regression — no `claude --bare` invocation appears in any subprocess in `~/.claude/` Tools / hooks / scripts.
- [x] ISC-29: Anti: regression — every channel that responds to non-{{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} humans uses API key billing, never OAuth.
- [ ] ISC-30: Antecedent: a new user can install PAI, name their DA, fill TELOS, and reach a working Life OS within an afternoon (the precondition for the Vision-stated euphoric surprise).

## Decisions

- 2025-late: PAI created when {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} started building scaffolding around Claude. DA named {{DA_FULL_NAME}}.
- 2026-04-21 (v4.0.0): PRD renamed to ISA — vocabulary release; ideal-state-artifact framing introduced.
- 2026-04-26 (v5.0.0): BPE compaction — removed prescriptive count floors; replaced with operational rules (granularity + binding-commitment).
- 2026-04-27 (v6.0.0): Frame shift — ISA elevated to universal primitive with five identities; mode-selection floor via EscalationGate; capability floors restored.
- 2026-04-28 (v6.1.0): Thinking-floor hardening — split capability floor into HARD thinking + soft delegation axes after a Deep tier task ran with zero thinking-skill invocations.
- 2026-04-28 (v6.2.0): Twelve-section ISA + ISA Skill — the body grew from five sections to twelve, the skill at `~/.claude/skills/ISA/` owns the canonical template and six workflows, the ID-stability rule formalizes ephemeral feature reconciliation, and the Deutsch C/R/L Changelog format gets a canonical writer in Append.

## Changelog

- 2026-04-28 | conjectured: shipping the v6.2.0 doctrine and the ISA skill in one Algorithm run was the right scope
  refuted by: Forge collaboration on AlgorithmSystem.md proved that parallel delegation earns its cost on heavy markdown rewrites; Advisor's commitment-boundary call surfaced that the C/R/L format would degrade without a canonical Append writer
  learned: doctrine-ship runs benefit from at least one delegation (heavy markdown) plus Advisor at the commitment boundary; the thinking floor and delegation soft floor are well-calibrated for this kind of work
  criterion now: ISC-13 (Append workflow gating C/R/L) added during BUILD rather than as a v6.2.x patch

- 2026-04-28 | conjectured: Out of Scope and anti-criteria are the same concept at different granularities
  refuted by: {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} articulated the distinction directly — Out of Scope is declarative ("we are not building X"), anti-criteria are derived testable probes ("X endpoint returns 404")
  learned: the three-guardrail taxonomy needs four surfaces — Principles bind thinking, Constraints bind solution space, Out of Scope binds vision, Anti-criteria bind test surface
  criterion now: ISC-9 documents the four-surface taxonomy; ISA body has `## Out of Scope` as section 3, distinct from `## Criteria` `Anti:` ISCs

## Verification

(Verification entries accumulate per ISC as the framework evolves. Each ISC's evidence comes from the canonical probes in Test Strategy.)

- ISC-1: `cat ~/.claude/PAI/ALGORITHM/LATEST` returned `6.2.0` on 2026-04-28T18:38:00Z.
- ISC-2: `ls ~/.claude/PAI/ALGORITHM/v6.2.0.md` confirms file exists, 596+ lines.
- ISC-12: SessionStart available-skills list includes `ISA: Owns the Ideal State Artifact…` (verified across multiple session reminders 2026-04-28).
- ISC-19: Pulse runs at `localhost:31337` — voice notification curls succeed throughout this session.
- ISC-27: `git -C ~/.claude remote -v` shows only `github.com/<your-github-user>/<your-private-pai-repo>` (private). Constitutional rule in system prompt enforces this.
