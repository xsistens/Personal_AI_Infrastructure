# USER/ — Your Identity Layer

This directory holds everything PAI knows about you: identity, voice,
goals, projects, work context. Files here are loaded by `CLAUDE.md`
@-imports at every session start, so the DA boots aware of who you
are and what you're working on.

## Layout

## Bootstrap

Files arrive as scaffolds. Run `/interview` to populate them with your
real answers. The interview is incremental — you can stop and resume.

## Privacy

Everything in this directory is **private** and never ships in any PAI
release. The release builder (`skills/_PAI/Tools/ShadowRelease.ts`)
deletes the entire `USER/` tree from staging and overlays generic
scaffolds in its place.
