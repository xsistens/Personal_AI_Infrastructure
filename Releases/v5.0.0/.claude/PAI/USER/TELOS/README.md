# TELOS — Your Life Operating Goals

> 🎯 SAMPLE TEMPLATES — Every `.md` file in this directory ships as a SAMPLE with placeholder entries marked `(sample)`. They show the SHAPE of populated TELOS data so you can see what to aim for. Run `/interview` (or talk to your DA) to replace the samples with your real mission, goals, beliefs, etc. Pulse will display populated entries here once you run the interview.

TELOS is your personal "why." These files describe what you're trying to do
with your life, what's getting in the way, and how you plan to handle it.
PAI reads them at every session start so the DA understands the context
behind any work you ask for.

## Files

| File | What goes in it |
|------|------------------|
| `MISSION.md` | The 1–3 things you're putting your life behind. Big, durable, often unfinishable. |
| `GOALS.md` | Concrete year-scale goals tied to each mission. SMART-ish; revisited quarterly. |
| `PROBLEMS.md` | The world-level problems your work is trying to solve (vs. internal challenges). |
| `STRATEGIES.md` | The plays you've chosen to make progress on the problems. |
| `NARRATIVES.md` | The story you tell yourself and others about what you're doing and why. |
| `CHALLENGES.md` | Personal blockers — habits, fears, patterns that get in your way. |
| `BELIEFS.md` | The opinions and frames you operate from. The DA uses these to read drafts in your voice. |
| `WISDOM.md` | Lessons you've extracted from experience and want to keep applying. |
| `BOOKS.md` | Books that shaped you. Useful when the DA picks recommendations or framings. |
| `PRINCIPAL_TELOS.md` | **Auto-generated summary** of all the above. Loaded into every session via CLAUDE.md. |

## Subdirectories

| Dir | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `CURRENT_STATE/` | Where you are right now across the dimensions of your life — health, finances, relationships, work, learning. The DA uses this as the starting point for any "how do I get from here to there" question. Sample scaffolds inside. |
| `IDEAL_STATE/` | Where you want to be — the vision you're aiming at across the same dimensions. Sample scaffolds inside. |
| `Backups/` | Versioned snapshots of your TELOS files. Tools that bulk-edit TELOS write a backup here before changing anything. Empty until something is backed up. |

## How to fill these in

**Easiest:** run `/interview` after install. It walks you through each file
in order, asks the right questions, and writes your answers to disk —
replacing every `(sample)` entry with content that's actually yours.

**By hand:** open each `.md` file. The bootstrap content shows the shape —
delete the placeholders and write your real answers. Keep entries short and
high-signal; the DA reads everything in this directory at session start.

**From existing data:** if you already have goals/missions in Obsidian,
Notion, journal entries, or a Telos repo, run the **Migrate** skill before
`/interview` to import what you have. The interview will then fill gaps
instead of asking you to re-type things.

## Regenerate the summary

Whenever you edit a file in this directory, regenerate the summary so
session-start context stays in sync:

```bash
bun ~/.claude/PAI/TOOLS/GenerateTelosSummary.ts
```

(`/interview` calls this automatically when it finishes a phase.)

## Privacy

This directory ships only as a bootstrap scaffold of samples. Anything you
write here stays on your machine and never reaches a public PAI release.
The release builder strips `PAI/USER/**` and overlays a fresh sample
scaffold for each new installer.
