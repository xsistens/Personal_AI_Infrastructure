/**
 * InterviewIdealState — agenda tracker for seeding IDEAL_STATE + preference files.
 *
 * Not an interactive interviewer — {{DA_NAME}} does the interviewing in chat. This tool
 * organizes the agenda: what's still TBD across all files, in what order, and
 * tracks progress so {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} can do the interview in one 90-min block OR three
 * 30-min bursts (Decision #4).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun InterviewIdealState.ts --next         Show next dimension to interview
 *   bun InterviewIdealState.ts --status       Progress report across all files
 *   bun InterviewIdealState.ts --dimension X  Show TBD markers for dimension X
 *   bun InterviewIdealState.ts --mark-done X  Mark dimension X complete
