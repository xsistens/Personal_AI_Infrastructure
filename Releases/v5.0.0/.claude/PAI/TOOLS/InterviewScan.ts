/**
 * InterviewScan — comprehensive completeness scanner across TELOS + IDEAL_STATE +
 * preferences + identity. Produces a prioritized gap report so `/interview` can
 * dynamically build the conversation around what's actually missing.
 *
 * Scans every relevant file, computes per-file completeness, weights by leverage
 * (files that unlock other files score higher), and outputs either a human-readable
 * gap report or a JSON plan the Interview skill consumes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun InterviewScan.ts                 Human-readable gap report (default)
 *   bun InterviewScan.ts --json          JSON for programmatic consumption
 *   bun InterviewScan.ts --next          Show single next priority target + prompts
 *   bun InterviewScan.ts --file <path>   Deep-scan single file
