# Memory System

**PAI's file-system-based memory. Everything we know, everything we've learned, everything we've researched, everything we're working on.**

This is not a narrow event log or a preferences store. This is PAI's comprehensive knowledge system — the full shared memory between {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} and {{DA_NAME}}. If we built knowledge together, it belongs here. That includes: work tracking, learnings from failures and successes, research and OSINT investigations, contact dossiers, security events, runtime state, and any other knowledge that would be valuable in future conversations.

**Two storage layers:**
- **PAI MEMORY** (`~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/`) — structured, hook-driven, entity-based
- **Auto-Memory** (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`) — unstructured learnings, research findings, contact profiles, reference material — anything Claude captures during sessions

Both layers are memory. Both are persistent. Both should be used.

**Version:** 7.6 (Retrieval + Navigation + Mining + Temporal, 2026-04-07)
**Location:** `~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/` + `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`

---

## Architecture

**Claude Code's `projects/` is the source of truth for transcripts. Hooks capture domain-specific events directly. Harvesting tools extract learnings from session transcripts. Auto-memory captures everything else — research, OSINT, contact profiles, reference material.**

Retrieval & Navigation (on-demand):
    ├── MemoryRetriever → compressed context from KNOWLEDGE/ (BM25 search + LLM compression)

```

**Key insight:** Hooks write directly to specialized directories. There is no intermediate "firehose" layer - Claude Code's `projects/` serves that purpose natively. Retrieval tools read the same markdown files without any intermediate index or database.

## Directory Details

### Claude Code projects/ - Native Session Storage

**Location:** `~/.claude/projects/-Users-{username}--claude/`
*(Replace `{username}` with your system username, e.g., `-Users-john--claude`)*
**What populates it:** Claude Code automatically (every conversation)
**Content:** Complete session transcripts in JSONL format
**Format:** `{uuid}.jsonl` - one file per session
**Retention:** 30 days (Claude Code manages cleanup)
**Purpose:** Source of truth for all session data; harvesting tools read from here

This is the actual "firehose" - every message, tool call, and response. PAI leverages this native storage rather than duplicating it.

### KNOWLEDGE/ - Organized Knowledge Archive

**What populates it:** Algorithm LEARN phase (direct writes with schema enforcement), manual `/knowledge add`, KnowledgeHarvester.ts (validates against schema, reflections disabled)
**Content:** Curated knowledge notes organized by entity type — people, companies, ideas, research. Topic is a tag, not a domain.
**Format:** Markdown files with YAML frontmatter (entity_type, tags, status). Full object type definitions in `_schema.md`.
**Purpose:** Browsable, organized archive of entities we'd look up by name — harvested from sessions and manual captures

**4 entity types:** People (human beings — OSINT, contacts, profiles), Companies (organizations — research, competitors, partners), Ideas (insights, theses, analyses, frameworks), Research (multi-source investigations with methodology and verified findings)
**The lookup test:** "Would {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} look this up by name?" — if yes, it's knowledge. If not, it belongs in WORK/ or LEARNING/.
**Research vs. Ideas:** If it involved multiple sources, parallel investigation, verification, and produced a comprehensive dataset — it's research. A single insight or thesis is an idea. Research entries link to full output in WORK/.
**What doesn't belong:** Task logs, algorithm reflections, ISA checklists, verification stubs → WORK/ and LEARNING/, not KNOWLEDGE/
**Note types:** reference, synthesis, moc, source, temporal
**Status lifecycle:** seedling → budding → evergreen (90-day expiry for unreferenced seedlings → `_archive/`)
**Linking:** `[[kebab-case-wikilinks]]` for explicit links, tags for cross-cutting, `rg` for backlinks, semantic embeddings deferred
**Navigation:** `_index.md` MOC dashboards per entity type (auto-generated, structured: recently-updated, most-referenced, by-tag, seedlings)

**Key principle:** Algorithm LEARN phase writes directly with proper schemas (best context to capture what was learned). Harvester validates against schema and handles maintenance. Topic (security, AI, business) is a tag on the entity, not a separate domain.

### WORK/ - Primary Work Tracking

**What populates it:**
- Algorithm (AI) creates work dir with ISA.md during execution
- `WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts` on Stop (updates ISA/THREAD)
- `SessionCleanup.hook.ts` on SessionEnd (marks COMPLETED)

**Content:** Flat work directories with a single ISA.md as source of truth
**Format:** `WORK/{timestamp}_{slug}/ISA.md` — consolidated metadata + ISC + decisions + changelog
**Purpose:** Track all discrete work units with lineage, verification, and feedback

**ISA.md Structure (v4.0 — consolidated single file):**
- **YAML frontmatter** — session metadata (id, title, session_id, status, effort_level, completed_at, iteration count, verification_summary)
- **STATUS** — progress table (criteria passing, phase, next action, blockers)
- **APPETITE** — time budget, circuit breaker, ISC target count
- **CONTEXT** — problem space from user prompt, key files
- **RISKS & RABBIT HOLES** — populated during THINK phase
- **PLAN** — populated during PLAN phase
- **IDEAL STATE CRITERIA** — checkbox markdown (`- [x]`/`- [ ]`) as system of record
- **DECISIONS** — non-obvious technical decisions logged during BUILD/EXECUTE
- **CHANGELOG** — timestamped entries replacing THREAD.md

**Work Directory Lifecycle:**
1. Algorithm execution → AI creates work dir with ISA.md (frontmatter includes session metadata)
2. `PostToolUse` → ISASync syncs ISA frontmatter to work.json on Write/Edit
3. `SessionEnd` → SessionCleanup marks ISA status COMPLETED, clears state

**Note:** Legacy work directories (pre-2026-02-22) may have META.yaml, ISC.json, THREAD.md alongside ISA.md. All consumers check ISA.md frontmatter first, fall back to legacy files.

### LEARNING/ - Categorized Learnings

**What populates it:**
- `SatisfactionCapture.hook.ts` (explicit ratings + implicit sentiment + low-rating learnings)
- `WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts` (significant work session completions)
- `SessionHarvester.ts` (periodic extraction from projects/ transcripts)
- `LearningPatternSynthesis.ts` (aggregates ratings into pattern reports)

**Structure:**
- `LEARNING/SYSTEM/YYYY-MM/` - PAI/tooling learnings (infrastructure issues)
- `LEARNING/ALGORITHM/YYYY-MM/` - Task execution learnings (approach errors)
- `LEARNING/SYNTHESIS/YYYY-MM/` - Aggregated pattern analysis (weekly/monthly reports)
- `LEARNING/REFLECTIONS/algorithm-reflections.jsonl` - Algorithm performance reflections (Q1/Q2/Q3 from LEARN phase)
- `LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl` - All user satisfaction ratings

**Categorization logic:**
| Directory | When Used | Example Triggers |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| `SYSTEM/` | Tooling/infrastructure failures | hook crash, config error, deploy failure |
| `ALGORITHM/` | Task execution issues | wrong approach, over-engineered, missed the point |
| `FAILURES/` | Full context for low ratings (1-3) | severe frustration, repeated errors |
| `REFLECTIONS/` | Algorithm performance analysis | per-session 3-question reflection from LEARN phase |
| `SYNTHESIS/` | Pattern aggregation | weekly analysis, recurring issues |

### LEARNING/FAILURES/ - Full Context Failure Analysis

**What populates it:**
- `SatisfactionCapture.hook.ts` via `FailureCapture.ts` (for ratings 1-3)
- Manual migration via `bun FailureCapture.ts --migrate`

**Content:** Complete context dumps for low-sentiment events
**Format:** `FAILURES/YYYY-MM/{timestamp}_{8-word-description}/`
**Purpose:** Enable retroactive learning system analysis by preserving full context

**Each failure directory contains:**
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `CONTEXT.md` | Human-readable analysis with metadata, root cause notes |
| `transcript.jsonl` | Full raw conversation up to the failure point |
| `sentiment.json` | Sentiment analysis output (rating, confidence, detailed analysis) |
| `tool-calls.json` | Extracted tool calls with inputs and outputs |

**Directory naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_eight-word-description-from-inference`
- Timestamp in PST
- 8-word description generated by fast inference to capture failure essence

**Rating thresholds:**
| Rating | Capture Level |
|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Full failure capture + learning file |
| 2 | Full failure capture + learning file |
| 3 | Full failure capture + learning file |
| 4-5 | Learning file only (if warranted) |
| 6-10 | No capture (positive/neutral) |

**Why this exists:** When significant frustration occurs (1-3), a brief summary isn't enough. Full context enables:
1. Root cause identification - what sequence led to the failure?
2. Pattern detection - do similar failures share characteristics?
3. Systemic improvement - what changes would prevent this class of failure?

### RESEARCH/ - Investigations & Agent Outputs

**What populates it:** Agent tasks write directly; OSINT workflows; any multi-agent research
**Content:** Agent completion outputs, OSINT dossiers, investigation reports, competitive analysis, deep dives
**Format:** `RESEARCH/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_AGENT-type_description.md`
**Purpose:** Archive of all research and investigation work — the structured output side of knowledge we build together

**Note:** Research findings should ALSO be summarized as auto-memory entries (reference type in `projects/<project>/memory/`) so they're discoverable at session start. RESEARCH/ holds the full output; auto-memory holds the summary and pointer.

### SECURITY/ - Security Events (Active — v3.0)

**What populates it:** `SecurityPipeline.hook.ts` on tool validation
**Content:** Security audit events (blocks, confirmations, alerts)
**Format:** `SECURITY/security-events.jsonl`
**Purpose:** Security decision audit trail

### STATE/ - Fast Runtime Data

**What populates it:** Various tools and hooks
**Content:** High-frequency read/write JSON files for runtime state
**Key Property:** Ephemeral - can be rebuilt from RAW or other sources. Optimized for speed, not permanence.

**Key contents:**
- `algorithms/` - Per-session algorithm state files (`{sessionId}.json` — phase, criteria, effort level, active flag)
- `kitty-sessions/` - Per-session Kitty terminal env (`{sessionId}.json` — listenOn, windowId for tab control and voice gating)
- `tab-titles/` - Per-window tab state (`{windowId}.json` — title, color, phase for daemon recovery)
- `session-names.json` - Auto-generated session names from SessionAutoName hook
- `current-work.json` - Active work directory pointer
- `progress/` - Multi-session project tracking
- `integrity/` - System health check results

This is mutable state that changes during execution - not historical records. If deleted, system recovers gracefully.

**`events.jsonl` - Unified Event Log:**

An append-only JSONL file where hooks emit structured, typed events alongside their normal state writes. Each line is a JSON object with `timestamp`, `session_id`, `source`, `type`, and type-specific fields. The type field uses a dot-separated topic hierarchy (e.g., `algorithm.phase`, `work.created`, `rating.captured`, `voice.sent`). This file is an observability layer -- it does NOT replace any of the mutable state files listed above. Events are written by `${PAI_DIR}/hooks/lib/observability-transport.ts` using synchronous append, and errors are silently swallowed so the event log never disrupts hook execution. Consumers can tail or `fs.watch` this file for real-time visibility into PAI activity.

### PAISYSTEMUPDATES/ - Change History

**What populates it:** Manual via CreateUpdate.ts tool
**Content:** Canonical tracking of all system changes
**Purpose:** Track architectural decisions and system changes over time

## Hook Integration

| Hook | Trigger | Writes To |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Algorithm (AI) | During execution | WORK/ISA.md, STATE/current-work-{sessionId}.json |
| ISASync.hook.ts | PostToolUse (Write/Edit) | STATE/work.json (syncs ISA frontmatter) + CF KV |
| KVSync.hook.ts | SessionStart, SessionEnd | CF KV `sync:work_state` (ensures dashboard freshness) |
| WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts | SessionEnd | LEARNING/ (significant work) |
| SessionCleanup.hook.ts | SessionEnd | WORK/ISA.md (status→COMPLETED), clears STATE |
| SatisfactionCapture.hook.ts | UserPromptSubmit | LEARNING/SIGNALS/, LEARNING/, FAILURES/ (1-3) |
| SecurityPipeline.hook.ts | PreToolUse | SECURITY/ |
| PreCompact.hook.ts | PreCompact | stdout (handover context) |

> **Note:** All hooks listed above also emit typed events to `STATE/events.jsonl` via `appendEvent()`. See [../Hooks/HookSystem.md § Unified Event System](../Hooks/HookSystem.md) for event types and consumer details.

## Migration History

**2026-04-07:** Memory System v7.6 - Retrieval + Navigation + Mining + Temporal
- Added `MemoryRetriever.ts` — BM25-lite search across KNOWLEDGE/ with optional LLM compression via Inference.ts fast. Returns compressed context within configurable token budget.
- Added `KnowledgeGraph.ts` — In-memory graph over KNOWLEDGE/ frontmatter tags, wikilinks, and related fields. BFS traversal, stats, hubs, related notes, tag search. Computed at query time, zero persistent storage.
- Added `--mine` flag to `SessionHarvester.ts` — Regex-based classification of conversation segments into decisions, preferences, milestones, problems. Candidates written to `KNOWLEDGE/_harvest-queue/` for review, never directly to KNOWLEDGE/.
- Added `valid_from`/`valid_until` optional frontmatter fields to all 4 entity types in `_schema.md` — Temporal fact validity tracking. Contradiction detector now skips note pairs with non-overlapping validity windows.
- Updated `KnowledgeHarvester.ts contradictions` command to check temporal fields before flagging pairs.
- Knowledge skill updated with `graph`, `retrieve`, and `mine` commands.
- Pulse wiki module's `/api/wiki/graph` endpoint uses wikilinks only; `KnowledgeGraph.ts` provides richer graph (tags + wikilinks + related fields) via CLI.

- Added PreCompact hook to settings.json (matcher: `"*"` for auto + manual)
- Documented auto-dream (server-controlled consolidation feature)
- PAI hooks and auto-memory now coexist: hooks for structured domain events, auto-memory for unstructured learnings

**2026-02-22:** v7.2 - ISA Consolidation (v4.0 work directories)
- Consolidated META.yaml, ISC.json, THREAD.md into single ISA.md per work directory
- ISA.md frontmatter now holds session metadata (title, session_id, status, completed_at)
- ISC section in ISA (checkbox markdown) is the system of record for criteria
- CHANGELOG section in ISA replaces THREAD.md
- All hooks updated: SessionCleanup, WorkCompletionLearning, LoadContext
- Legacy fallback preserved: consumers check ISA.md first, fall back to META.yaml/ISC.json

## Claude Code Auto-Memory & Auto-Dream

PAI coexists with Claude Code's built-in memory system rather than replacing it.

### Auto-Memory
**Location:** `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` (default, matches system prompt injection)
**Writer:** Claude (automatic, during sessions)
**Index:** `MEMORY.md` — first 200 lines loaded at every session start
**Content:** Everything that doesn't have a structured hook — research findings, OSINT dossiers, contact profiles, user preferences, corrections, patterns, reference material, and any other knowledge built during sessions

Auto-memory is not a narrow preferences store. It is the general-purpose knowledge layer of PAI's memory system. If we built knowledge together and it would be valuable in a future conversation, it belongs here. Types include:
- **user** — who {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} is, how to work with him
- **feedback** — corrections and confirmed approaches
- **project** — ongoing work context, decisions, deadlines
- **reference** — pointers to external resources, research summaries, contact dossiers, OSINT findings

PAI's hooks capture structured domain-specific events (LEARNING/, WORK/, SIGNALS/). Auto-memory captures everything else.

**Configuration:**
- Enabled by default (`autoMemoryEnabled` not set = true)
- No custom `autoMemoryDirectory` — uses default path so system prompt path matches
- Manage via `/memory` command in any session

### Auto-Dream (Server-Controlled)
**Trigger:** Server-side feature flag — runs between sessions when 24+ hours and 5+ sessions have elapsed
**What it does:** Background subagent consolidates auto-memory files — prunes stale entries, resolves contradictions, converts relative dates, deduplicates

PAI doesn't control auto-dream activation. When it runs, it operates on the auto-memory directory above.

### PreCompact Hook
**What:** Preserves active work context before conversation compaction
**Hook:** `PreCompact.hook.ts` (matcher: `"*"`)
**Captures:** Active task, ISA summary, files modified, key decisions, session ID
**Output:** Structured handover note on stdout, preserved through compaction

### How PAI Memory and Auto-Memory Coexist

| System | Writer | Content | Loaded When |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Auto-Memory (`MEMORY.md`) | Claude | All shared knowledge: research, contacts, corrections, patterns, references | First 200 lines at session start |
| PAI WORK/ | Algorithm + hooks | Task tracking, ISAs, ISC | On demand via LoadContext |
| PAI LEARNING/ | Hooks + harvesters | Ratings, failures, synthesis | On demand via dynamic context |
| PAI STATE/ | Hooks | Ephemeral runtime state | On demand |
| Auto-Dream | Claude (subagent) | Consolidated auto-memory | Runs between sessions |
| PreCompact | Hook | Work-in-progress handover | Before compaction |
