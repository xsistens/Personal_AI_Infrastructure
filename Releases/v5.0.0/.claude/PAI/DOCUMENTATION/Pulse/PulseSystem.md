# The Pulse System

**Pulse is the Life Dashboard.** It is the visible surface of the PAI Life Operating System — the place where you (and your DA) see and interact with everything the OS is doing. PAI is the OS; Pulse is how you watch it run.

Every Pulse module is a sub-surface of the Dashboard: real-time observability, voice notifications, chat surfaces (iMessage/Telegram), scheduled work, background worker state, DA heartbeat, and — as the dashboard grows — live views of current state vs ideal state, goal progress, workflows, and day-in-the-life preview. A Life OS with no dashboard would still be a Life OS; Pulse is what keeps it visible.

**Canonical thesis:** `PAI/DOCUMENTATION/LifeOs/LifeOsThesis.md` — the source of truth for what PAI is, what the DA is, and why Pulse exists.

**Implementation:** The unified daemon of PAI — a single always-on process that handles cron jobs, voice notifications, hook validation, observability APIs + dashboard, Telegram chat, iMessage chat, and GitHub work polling. Pulse is THE local runtime for all PAI services. It absorbed VoiceServer, TelegramBot, iMessageBot, and the Observability server into crash-isolated modules running under one process, one port (31337), and one launchd plist (`com.pai.pulse`).

**Version:** 2.0 (2026-04-01)
**Location:** `~/.claude/PAI/PULSE/`

---

## Subsystems

Each subsystem runs in its own crash-isolated loop within the single Pulse process. If one module crashes (e.g., Telegram loses connection), all other modules continue running uninterrupted.

| Module | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Cron** | Scheduled jobs -- the original heartbeat loop | `pulse.ts` |
| **Voice** | ElevenLabs TTS notifications | `VoiceServer/voice.ts` |
| **Hooks** | Skill-guard and agent-guard validation | `modules/hooks.ts` |
| **Observability** | Data APIs + Observatory dashboard + security management APIs (absorbed from observability-server.ts) | `Observability/observability.ts` |
| **Telegram** | grammY polling bot with claude-agent-sdk sessions (absorbed from TelegramBot) | `modules/telegram.ts` |
| **iMessage** | SQLite polling bot with claude-agent-sdk sessions (absorbed from iMessageBot, disabled by default) | `modules/imessage.ts` |
| **Worker** | GitHub Issues work polling for PAI Workers (optional) | `checks/github-work.ts` |
| **Assistant** | Digital Assistant identity, heartbeat, scheduling, growth | `Assistant/module.ts` |
| **UserIndex** | Life OS USER/ indexer — parses frontmatter + collections into typed JSON; fs.watch live refresh; powers `/life` dashboard + Daemon publish feed | `modules/user-index.ts` |

---

## Architecture

Pulse is a single Bun process managed by launchd on port 31337. On startup, it initializes all enabled subsystem modules (voice, hooks, observability, telegram, imessage), starts the HTTP server, launches the menu bar app, then enters the cron heartbeat loop. It reads job definitions from `PULSE.toml`, evaluates cron schedules, executes due jobs (either shell scripts or Claude CLI invocations), and routes output through internal dispatch (voice is now an in-process function call, not a separate HTTP request). There is no queue, no AI triage layer, no channel abstraction -- just run jobs and route output.

```
launchd (com.pai.pulse)
    |
    v
pulse.ts  (heartbeat loop)
    |
    +-- loadConfig() <-- PULSE.toml
    |
    +-- readState()  <-- state/state.json
    |
    +-- for each enabled job:
    |       |
    |       +-- isDue(schedule, now, lastRun)?
    |       |       |
    |       |       no --> skip
    |       |       |
    |       |       yes
    |       |       v
    |       +-- circuit breaker (3 consecutive failures --> skip)
    |       |
    |       +-- execute:
    |       |       script --> spawnScript(command)
    |       |       claude --> spawnClaude(prompt, model)
    |       |
    |       +-- isSentinel(output)?
    |       |       yes --> log "nothing to report", no dispatch
    |       |       no  --> dispatch(output, target)
    |       |
    |       +-- writeState() (atomic, after each job)
    |
    +-- smart sleep (next due time, capped at 60s)
    |
    +-- loop
```

---

## How It Works

### The Heartbeat Loop

Pulse runs an infinite loop. Each tick:

1. **Iterate** over every enabled job in `PULSE.toml`.
2. **Evaluate** each job's cron schedule against the current time.
3. **Check** the circuit breaker (skip if 3+ consecutive failures).
4. **Execute** the job (script or claude).
5. **Inspect** the output for sentinel values.
6. **Dispatch** non-sentinel output to the configured channel.
7. **Persist** state to disk after each job (atomic write).
8. **Sleep** until the next job is due, capped at 60 seconds for SIGTERM responsiveness.

### Job Evaluation

A job runs when two conditions are met:

- **Cron match:** The 5-field cron expression matches the current minute, hour, day, month, and weekday.
- **Dedup guard:** The job has not already run in the current minute (prevents double-execution within the same cron window).

The cron parser supports standard syntax: `*`, ranges (`1-5`), steps (`*/5`), lists (`1,3,5`), and combinations (`0-30/10`).

### Smart Sleep

After processing all jobs, Pulse computes how many milliseconds until the next job is due by scanning the next 60 minutes of cron windows. It sleeps for that duration, capped at 60 seconds (so SIGTERM is handled promptly). Minimum sleep is 1 second to avoid busy-looping.

---

## PULSE.toml Format

All jobs are defined in a single TOML file. Each job is a `[[job]]` table array entry.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | -- | Unique job identifier |
| `schedule` | string | yes | -- | 5-field cron expression |
| `type` | `"script"` or `"claude"` | no | `"script"` | Execution method |
| `command` | string | for script | -- | Shell command to run (supports `${ENV_VAR}` expansion) |
| `prompt` | string | for claude | -- | Prompt text sent to Claude CLI |
| `model` | string | no | `"sonnet"` | Claude model for claude-type jobs |
| `output` | `"voice"` / `"telegram"` / `"ntfy"` / `"log"` | no | `"log"` | Dispatch target for non-sentinel output |
| `enabled` | boolean | no | `true` | Whether the job runs |

### Module Configuration Sections

In addition to `[[job]]` entries, `PULSE.toml` contains configuration sections for each subsystem module:

| Section | Purpose | Key Fields |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `[voice]` | ElevenLabs TTS | `enabled`, `voice_id`, `default_voice_enabled` |
| `[telegram]` | Telegram bot | `enabled`, `bot_token` (or env var), `principal_chat_id` |
| `[imessage]` | iMessage bot | `enabled` (default `false`), `poll_interval_ms` |
| `[observability]` | Observatory dashboard + data/security APIs | `enabled`, `dashboard_path` (symlink to Observability/out) |
| `[hooks]` | Hook validation | `enabled`, `skill_guard`, `agent_guard` |

### Example

```toml
[voice]
enabled = true
voice_id = "<YOUR_ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID>"

[telegram]
enabled = true

[imessage]
enabled = false

[observability]
enabled = true

[hooks]
enabled = true

[[job]]
name = "calendar-reminder"
schedule = "*/10 * * * *"
type = "script"
command = "bun run checks/calendar.ts"
output = "voice"
enabled = true

[[job]]
name = "morning-brief"
schedule = "0 7 * * *"
type = "claude"
prompt = "Prepare a morning brief: today's calendar events..."
model = "sonnet"
output = "voice"
enabled = true
```

---

## Job Types

### Script Jobs (`type = "script"`)

Run a shell command via `bash -c`. The working directory is `~/.claude/Pulse/`. Environment variables from `~/.claude/.env` are available. The process has a 60-second timeout (SIGTERM on expiry).

Cost: $0. All computation is local or uses free APIs.

Script jobs are the default and should be preferred. Most checks follow a pattern: call an API, parse the response, output a notification string or a sentinel.

### Claude Jobs (`type = "claude"`)

Spawn `claude` headless via the `PAI/TOOLS/Inference.ts` flag pattern (`--print --model X --tools '' --output-format text --setting-sources '' --system-prompt ''`) with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` deleted from the subprocess env so OAuth/keychain billing applies. The prompt is piped via stdin. Output format is plain text. The process has a 5-minute timeout. **NEVER use `claude --bare`** — the `--bare` flag forces `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` auth and bypasses OAuth/keychain (per the constitutional rule in `PAI_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` "Operational Rules" — a real billing incident drove this rule).

Cost: Token-dependent. A Haiku job costs fractions of a cent. A Sonnet job processing a morning brief costs roughly $0.01-0.03.

Claude jobs are for tasks that require reasoning: urgency assessment, summarization, pattern detection. Use them sparingly -- most checks should be script jobs with optional AI triage as a second layer.

---

## Output Routing

When a job produces output, it is dispatched to one of four targets:

| Target | Destination | Max Length | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| `voice` | Internal voice module (`http://localhost:31337/notify`) | 500 chars | Spoken aloud via ElevenLabs; same process, internal function call |
| `telegram` | Telegram Bot API | 4096 chars | Requires `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_PRINCIPAL_CHAT_ID` in `.env` |
| `ntfy` | ntfy.sh push notification | 4096 chars | Requires `NTFY_TOPIC` in `.env` |
| `log` | stdout (already logged by main loop) | unlimited | Default; no external dispatch |

All dispatch calls have a 10-second timeout and fail gracefully -- a dispatch failure does not mark the job as failed.

---

## Sentinel Pattern

Checks often find nothing to report. Rather than dispatching empty or low-value notifications, check scripts output a **sentinel value** to suppress dispatch entirely.

Recognized sentinels:

| Sentinel | Typical Use |
|----------|-------------|
| `NO_ACTION` | GitHub: no new PRs or activity |
| `NO_URGENT` | Email: no urgent messages |
| `NO_EVENTS` | Calendar: no upcoming meetings |
| `HEARTBEAT_OK` | Generic: system is healthy, nothing to report (legacy sentinel, still recognized) |

An empty string also suppresses dispatch.

When the main loop detects a sentinel, it logs "nothing to report" and skips the dispatch call. The job is still recorded as successful in state.

Check scripts should always output a sentinel on their "nothing to report" path rather than exiting silently. This makes the protocol explicit and debuggable.

---

## Circuit Breaker

If a job fails 3 consecutive times, Pulse stops running it and logs a warning on each tick:

```
Skipping email-triage: 3 consecutive failures
```

The failure counter resets to 0 on any successful run. To recover a tripped breaker:

1. Fix the underlying issue.
2. Either restart Pulse (`manage.sh restart`) or manually edit `state/state.json` to reset `consecutiveFailures` to 0.

The threshold is hardcoded at `MAX_FAILURES = 3` in `pulse.ts`.

---

## State Management

### state.json

Located at `~/.claude/Pulse/state/state.json`. Written atomically (write to `.tmp`, rename) after each job execution.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "startedAt": 1743451200000,
  "jobs": {
    "email-triage": {
      "lastRun": 1743451500000,
      "lastResult": "ok",
      "consecutiveFailures": 0
    },
    "healthcheck": {
      "lastRun": 1743451500000,
      "lastResult": "error",
      "consecutiveFailures": 2
    }
  }
}
```

Fields per job:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `lastRun` | Unix timestamp (ms) of last execution |
| `lastResult` | `"ok"` or `"error"` |
| `consecutiveFailures` | Counter; resets on success, increments on failure |

If `state.json` is missing or corrupt, Pulse starts with an empty state. All jobs will be considered overdue and run on the first tick.

### Auxiliary State Files

Individual check scripts may maintain their own state files in `state/`:

| File | Used By | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `email-seen.json` | `checks/email.ts` | Dedup list of seen email IDs (max 200) |
| `github-seen.json` | `checks/github.ts` | Dedup list of seen PR keys (max 500) |
| `pulse.pid` | `pulse.ts` | Current process ID |

---

## Process Lifecycle

### launchd Integration

Pulse is managed by macOS launchd via `com.pai.pulse.plist`. Key properties:

| Property | Value | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `RunAtLoad` | `true` | Starts on login |
| `KeepAlive` | `true` | Auto-restarts on crash |
| `ThrottleInterval` | `30` | Minimum 30 seconds between restart attempts |
| `WorkingDirectory` | `~/.claude/Pulse` | CWD for the process |

Logs go to `~/.claude/Pulse/logs/pulse-stdout.log` and `pulse-stderr.log`.

### Startup

1. launchd spawns `bun run pulse.ts`.
2. Pulse writes its PID to `state/pulse.pid`.
3. Loads `PULSE.toml` and `state/state.json`.
4. Initializes all enabled subsystem modules (voice, hooks, observability, telegram, imessage).
5. Starts the HTTP server on port 31337.
6. Launches the menu bar app (`PAI Pulse.app`) automatically.
7. Logs enabled job/module count and names.
8. Enters the cron heartbeat loop.

### Shutdown

Pulse registers handlers for `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`. On signal:

1. Sets `shuttingDown = true`.
2. The current tick completes (no new jobs start).
3. Final state is persisted to disk.
4. Process exits cleanly.

### Crash Recovery

If Pulse crashes, launchd restarts it within 30 seconds (ThrottleInterval). On restart, state is loaded from disk -- jobs that were overdue during the downtime will run on the first tick. No data is lost because state is written after each job, not at shutdown.

---

## Adding and Modifying Jobs

### Adding a New Script Job

1. Create the check script in `checks/`:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env bun
// checks/my-check.ts

async function main() {
  // Do your check
  const result = await someCheck()

  if (!result) {
    console.log("NO_ACTION")
    return
  }

  // Output a human-readable notification
  console.log("Something happened that needs attention")
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(`my-check error: ${err}`)
  console.log("NO_ACTION")
})
```

2. Add the job to `PULSE.toml`:

```toml
[[job]]
name = "my-check"
schedule = "*/15 * * * *"
type = "script"
command = "bun run checks/my-check.ts"
output = "telegram"
enabled = true
```

3. Restart Pulse: `~/.claude/Pulse/manage.sh restart`

### Modifying an Existing Job

Edit `PULSE.toml` and restart Pulse. The state for renamed jobs will not carry over -- the old job's state remains in `state.json` as dead weight (harmless) and the new job starts fresh.

### Disabling a Job

Set `enabled = false` in `PULSE.toml` and restart. The job's state is preserved in case it is re-enabled.

---

## Check Scripts

### email.ts -- Email Triage

**Schedule:** Every 5 minutes
**Output:** voice
**Cost:** $0 when no new emails; ~$0.001 per triage (Haiku)

Two-layer design:
1. **Layer 1 (free):** Fetches unread emails via the `_INBOX` skill's `Manage.ts` tool. Deduplicates against a seen list (`state/email-seen.json`, max 200 entries). If no new emails, outputs `NO_URGENT`.
2. **Layer 2 (cheap):** Sends new email subjects/senders to Haiku for urgency assessment. Only flags genuinely urgent items: security incidents, 24-hour deadlines, explicit ASAP requests, financial/medical alerts. Newsletters, meeting invites, and routine updates are not urgent.

### calendar.ts -- Calendar Reminders

**Schedule:** Every 10 minutes
**Output:** voice
**Cost:** $0

Fetches events from all Google Calendars within a 30-minute lookahead window via the Google Calendar API. Deduplicates by event ID across calendars. Formats up to 3 upcoming events as spoken notifications ("Team standup in 12 minutes. Design review in 25 minutes."). Outputs `NO_EVENTS` when the window is clear.

### github.ts -- GitHub PR Monitor

**Schedule:** Every 30 minutes
**Output:** telegram
**Cost:** $0

Monitors open PRs across the repositories you configure. Deduplicates against a seen list (`state/github-seen.json`, max 500 entries). Reports new PRs with repo, number, title, and author. Outputs `NO_ACTION` when there is no new activity.

### health.ts -- Website Health Check

**Schedule:** Every 5 minutes
**Output:** ntfy
**Cost:** $0

Sends HTTP HEAD requests to the sites you configure with 10-second timeouts. Reports failures with status codes or error messages. Outputs `NO_ACTION` when all sites are healthy.

---

## Relationship to Claude Code /schedule

Claude Code has a built-in `/schedule` command that creates remote agents running on a cron schedule. These are **session-scoped triggers** -- they run as full Claude Code sessions in the cloud, have access to your codebase context, and are managed through Claude Code's interface.

Pulse is different:

| | Pulse | /schedule |
|---|---|---|
| **Runs** | Locally, always-on daemon | Remote, cloud-based |
| **Scope** | Lightweight checks, monitoring | Full Claude Code sessions |
| **Cost** | $0 for script jobs | Full session token cost |
| **Persistence** | Survives reboots (launchd) | Managed by Claude Code |
| **Use case** | Email, calendar, health checks | Complex recurring analysis |

There is no conflict. Pulse handles high-frequency, low-cost local monitoring. /schedule handles heavy, infrequent cloud work. They can coexist and even complement each other (e.g., Pulse detects an issue, /schedule runs deeper analysis).

---

## Relationship to Old Monitor

Pulse replaces PAI Monitor entirely. Monitor was a 3,283-line TypeScript system with:

- A channel-based pub/sub architecture
- An AI triage layer for routing decisions
- A queue system with priority scheduling
- Complex lifecycle management
- Multiple abstraction layers

It was built for a future that never arrived and had been dormant for months.

Pulse does the same useful work in ~1,050 lines across 9 files, with no abstractions beyond what the jobs require. The old Monitor directory should be considered archived.

Pulse also replaces the ScheduledTasks system, which used individual shell scripts and multiple launchd plists for each task. Pulse consolidates all scheduled work into a single daemon with a single plist and a single configuration file.

As of v2.0, Pulse also absorbed four previously standalone services into its module system: VoiceServer (ElevenLabs TTS, formerly port 8888), the Observability server (data APIs + Observatory dashboard), TelegramBot (grammY polling), and iMessageBot (SQLite polling). Each runs as a crash-isolated module under the single Pulse process on port 31337.

---

## Cost Model

### Script Jobs: $0

Email, calendar, GitHub, and health checks use free APIs (Gmail, Google Calendar, GitHub REST, HTTP HEAD). The only cost is local compute (negligible).

The email check has an optional AI layer (Haiku urgency triage) that fires only when new emails arrive. Cost: ~$0.001 per invocation.

### Claude Jobs: Token Cost

| Job | Model | Schedule | Est. Cost/Run | Est. Cost/Day |
|-----|-------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| morning-brief | Sonnet | 1x daily (7 AM) | ~$0.02 | ~$0.02 |
| memory-consolidation | Sonnet | 1x daily (3 AM) | ~$0.03 | ~$0.03 |
| proactive-suggestions | Haiku | 3x daily (disabled) | ~$0.005 | ~$0.015 |

**Total estimated daily cost with current enabled jobs:** ~$0.05/day + negligible email triage costs.

With all jobs enabled including proactive-suggestions: ~$0.065/day.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Check Status

```bash
~/.claude/Pulse/manage.sh status
```

Shows PID, uptime, and per-job last run times with failure counts.

### View Logs

```bash
# Recent stdout (structured JSON)
tail -50 ~/.claude/Pulse/logs/pulse-stdout.log

# Recent errors
tail -50 ~/.claude/Pulse/logs/pulse-stderr.log

# Follow live
tail -f ~/.claude/Pulse/logs/pulse-stdout.log | bun -e "process.stdin.on('data', d => { try { const e = JSON.parse(d); console.log(e.ts, e.level, e.msg) } catch {} })"
```

### Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "NOT RUNNING (no PID file)" | Pulse not started or crashed without recovery | `manage.sh install` |
| "DEAD (stale PID)" | Process died but launchd did not restart | `manage.sh restart` |
| Job stuck in circuit breaker | 3+ consecutive failures | Fix the check script, then `manage.sh restart` |
| "Telegram dispatch skipped" | Missing env vars | Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_PRINCIPAL_CHAT_ID` in `~/.claude/.env` |
| "ntfy dispatch skipped" | Missing env var | Set `NTFY_TOPIC` in `~/.claude/.env` |
| Voice notifications silent | Voice module not running or Pulse down | `manage.sh restart`; check `[voice] enabled = true` in PULSE.toml |
| Calendar returns NO_EVENTS always | Missing or expired refresh token | Set `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_REFRESH_TOKEN` in `~/.claude/.env` |
| State file corrupt | Interrupted write (unlikely, writes are atomic) | Delete `state/state.json` and restart |

### Manual Job Test

Run a check script directly to verify it works:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/Pulse
bun run checks/health.ts
bun run checks/calendar.ts
bun run checks/email.ts
bun run checks/github.ts
```

## Menu Bar App

PAI Pulse includes a native macOS menu bar app that shows daemon status at a glance. The menu bar app is launched automatically by Pulse on startup -- no separate launchd plist needed.

**Location:** `~/.claude/PAI/PULSE/MenuBar/`
**Installed to:** `~/Applications/PAI Pulse.app`
**Launched by:** Pulse process on startup (no separate launchd plist)

### What It Shows

- Status icon: green (running), yellow (stale tick >2min), red (jobs failing), gray (stopped)
- Uptime
- Each job: name, schedule (human readable), last run time, status
- Start/Stop/Restart controls (calls `manage.sh`)
- Quick access to logs and PULSE.toml

### How It Determines Status

Reads `state/state.json` directly every 5 seconds (no HTTP endpoint needed). Checks:
- File modification time for freshness
- `pulse.pid` process existence
- `consecutiveFailures` counts for job health

### Building and Installing

```bash
cd ~/.claude/PAI/PULSE/MenuBar
bash install.sh    # Builds, deploys to ~/Applications, installs plist
```

To rebuild after changes:
```bash
bash build.sh      # Compiles PulseMenuBar.swift → PAI Pulse.app
```

---

## Hook Validation Server

Pulse includes an integrated HTTP hook validation server as the `hooks` module (`modules/hooks.ts`). Hook routes are served on the same port 31337 as all other Pulse HTTP endpoints.

### Routes

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `/hooks/skill-guard` | POST | Blocks false-positive skill invocations (e.g., `keybindings-help` triggered by position bias) |
| `/hooks/agent-guard` | POST | Foreground agents: warns "consider run_in_background: true". Background agents: injects watchdog Monitor reminder (`Tools/AgentWatchdog.ts`) to detect hung agents via tool-activity.jsonl silence. |
| `/health` | GET | Returns unified status: Pulse jobs + module health + hook stats |

### Behavior

- **Fail-open:** If Pulse is unreachable, Claude Code treats hooks as non-blocking success. This is acceptable for skill-guard (minor annoyance) and agent-guard (warning only). These Pulse HTTP routes are the ONLY implementation — the standalone `.hook.ts` files (`SkillGuard.hook.ts`, `AgentExecutionGuard.hook.ts`) were deleted.
- **Security hooks stay as command hooks:** `SecurityPipeline.hook.ts` uses `process.exit(2)` for hard-blocking. HTTP hooks would fail-open on connection failure, which is unacceptable for security operations.
- **Port:** 31337 (shared with all Pulse modules), bound to 127.0.0.1 only.

### Hook Configuration

The hooks are configured in `~/.claude/settings.json` as HTTP hooks pointing to `http://localhost:31337/hooks/*`.

The official PAI font system uses Butterick fonts (practicaltyography.com). These fonts are used across all PAI UI surfaces — the Pulse Observatory dashboard, marketing sites, and blog.

### Font Roles

| Role | Font Family | CSS Name | Usage |
|------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Body sans** | Concourse T3 | `concourse-t3` | All body text, paragraphs, UI labels |
| **Display headings** | Advocate C14 | `advocate-c14` | Section headers, nav labels, page titles |
| **Narrow headings** | Advocate N34 | `advocate-n34` | h2 headings, subheadings |
| **Tab/branding** | Advocate C41 | `advocate-c41` | Logo text, branding elements |
| **Caps labels** | Heliotrope Caps | `heliotrope-caps` | Uppercase section labels, h3 |
| **Serif text** | Heliotrope T3 | `heliotrope-t3` | Serif body text |
| **Serif accent** | Valkyrie Text | `valkyrie-text` | h1 headings, identity cards, prose |
| **Monospace** | Triplicate A Code | `triplicate-a-code` | Code blocks, data values, cron expressions |
| **Serif body** | Equity Text | `equity-text` | Blockquotes, editorial content |
| **Caps sans** | Concourse C3 | `concourse-c3` | Small caps, category labels |

### Heading Hierarchy (CSS)

```css
body     { font-family: 'concourse-t3', sans-serif; }
h1       { font-family: 'valkyrie-text', Georgia, serif; }
h2       { font-family: 'advocate-n34', sans-serif; }
h3       { font-family: 'heliotrope-caps', sans-serif; }
h4-h6    { font-family: 'advocate-c14', sans-serif; }
code     { font-family: 'triplicate-a-code', monospace; }
```

### Font Files

Font files live in `Pulse/Observability/public/fonts/` and are loaded via `@font-face` in `globals.css`. Source files are from {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}'s licensed Butterick font collection.

**Never use Google Fonts (Orbitron, Share Tech Mono) or system monospace fonts (JetBrains Mono) in PAI UI.**

## Observability Module -- Observatory Dashboard & Security APIs

The observability module (`Observability/observability.ts`) serves the Observatory dashboard and exposes data + security management APIs on port 31337.

### Dashboard Serving

Pulse serves the Observatory dashboard from a symlink:

```
Pulse/dashboard/out  →  Observability/out
```

The `Observability/out` directory is produced by the Next.js static export (`bun run build` in `PAI/Observability`). Pulse serves these files as static assets. All static files are served with aggressive no-cache headers:

```
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
```

This ensures the browser always picks up new builds without stale content.

### Deployment Procedure

After building the Observatory dashboard, Pulse must be restarted to pick up new files:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/PAI/Observability && bun run build
launchctl stop com.pai.pulse && launchctl start com.pai.pulse
```

**Do NOT use `kill -9` to restart Pulse.** Because launchd has `KeepAlive = true`, a killed process respawns immediately with potentially stale code. The `launchctl stop/start` sequence ensures a clean shutdown, state persistence, and fresh module initialization.

### Data APIs

The observability module serves all dashboard data. Full API reference with all ~40 endpoints is in `PAI/DOCUMENTATION/Observability/ObservabilitySystem.md` under "API Reference." Key categories:

| Category | Endpoints | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Core Observability | `/api/observability/*`, `/api/events/recent` | Session state, events, voice logs, tool failures |
| Algorithm & Sessions | `/api/algorithm`, `/api/agents`, `/api/novelty`, `/api/ladder` | Work sessions, subagents, learning signals |
| Life Dashboard | `/api/life/home`, `/api/life/health`, `/api/life/finances`, `/api/life/business`, `/api/life/work`, `/api/life/goals` | Narrative + domain data powering the `/life` biography dashboard |
| Life OS Index | `/api/user-index[?filter=stats\|publish\|stale\|gaps]` | Typed JSON of USER/ tree produced by `modules/user-index.ts` — spec: `PAI/DOCUMENTATION/LifeOs/LifeOsSchema.md` |
| Security | `/api/security`, `/api/security/patterns`, `/api/security/rules`, `/api/security/hooks-detail` | PATTERNS.yaml + SECURITY_RULES.md CRUD |
| Knowledge | `/api/knowledge`, `/api/knowledge/:domain/:slug` | Knowledge archive read/write |
| Wiki | `/api/wiki`, `/api/wiki/search`, `/api/wiki/graph` | System docs, full-text search, knowledge graph (wikilink-based; CLI `KnowledgeGraph.ts` provides richer graph with tags + related fields) |
| DA | `/assistant/*` | Identity, tasks, diary, opinions, personality |
| Voice | `/notify`, `/voice` | ElevenLabs TTS notifications |
| Hook Validation | `/hooks/skill-guard`, `/hooks/agent-guard` | PreToolUse HTTP hooks for Skill/Agent validation |

## DA Module -- Digital Assistant Subsystem

The DA module formalizes how Pulse instantiates, manages, and evolves a Digital Assistant. It replaces manual DA_IDENTITY.md editing with a structured schema, adds proactive heartbeat evaluation, natural-language scheduled tasks, and identity growth over time.

### Architecture

The DA module adds four capabilities to Pulse:

1. **Identity Registry** -- Structured YAML identity per DA with personality traits, voice config, writing style, autonomy rules
2. **Heartbeat** -- Proactive "should I do something?" evaluation every 30 minutes (2-layer: free context + cheap Haiku eval, ~$0.05/day)
3. **Scheduled Tasks** -- JSONL-based task store with natural language creation, persistent across restarts
4. **Growth Engine** -- Daily diary, weekly opinion formation, bounded identity evolution

### Configuration

```toml
[da]
enabled = true
primary = "your-da"
heartbeat_schedule = "*/30 * * * *"
heartbeat_model = "haiku"
heartbeat_cost_ceiling = 0.01
diary_schedule = "0 23 * * *"
growth_schedule = "0 4 * * 0"
```

### File Structure

```
PAI/USER/DA/
  _registry.yaml                # Which DAs exist, which is primary
  _presets.yaml                 # Personality presets for interview
  your-da/
    DA_IDENTITY.yaml               # Structured identity (source of truth)
    DA_IDENTITY.md                 # Generated readable version
    growth.jsonl                # Append-only growth events
    opinions.yaml               # Confidence-weighted beliefs
    diary.jsonl                 # Daily interaction summaries
  devi/
    DA_IDENTITY.yaml
    DA_IDENTITY.md
    growth.jsonl
    opinions.yaml
    diary.jsonl
```

### Identity Schema

The DA_IDENTITY.yaml schema covers: core identity (name, role, color), voice config, 12 personality traits (0-100), writing style, relationship context, autonomy rules (can_initiate vs must_ask), companion, and growth anchors.

### Heartbeat

Two-layer architecture:
- **Layer 1 ($0):** Deterministic context gathering -- calendar, email, active work, pending tasks, recent ratings
- **Layer 2 (~$0.001):** Single Haiku evaluation -- should I notify, remind, create a task, or stay silent?

Most evaluations return NO_ACTION. Cost: ~$0.05/day ($1.50/month).

### Scheduled Tasks

Tasks are stored in `Pulse/Assistant/state/scheduled-tasks.jsonl`. Types:
- **once** -- fires at a specific time, then completes
- **recurring** -- fires on cron schedule until cancelled or expired

Actions: notify (voice/telegram), prompt (LLM call), script (shell command).

Natural language routing:
- "remind me at 9am" --> Pulse local task (free)
- "every Monday research security news" --> CC trigger (cloud)

### Growth System

Three mechanisms:
1. **Diary** (daily 11PM) -- Summarizes sessions, topics, mood, notable moments
2. **Opinions** (weekly Sunday 4AM) -- Forms confidence-weighted beliefs about the principal
3. **Identity drift** (monthly) -- Personality traits evolve within bounded ranges (max 5 points/month)

### DA Interview

New PAI installations create DA identity via guided CLI interview:
```bash
bun PAI/TOOLS/DAInterview.ts                    # Quick (under 2 min)
bun PAI/TOOLS/DAInterview.ts --depth standard   # + personality refinement
bun PAI/TOOLS/DAInterview.ts --depth deep       # + companion, beliefs
```

### Multi-DA Support

Registry tracks primary + worker DAs. Primary owns interactive channels (terminal, telegram, voice). Workers run background tasks only. Each DA has independent identity, growth, and opinions.

### HTTP API

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/assistant/health` | GET | Assistant subsystem health |
| `/assistant/identity` | GET | Current identity summary |
| `/assistant/tasks` | GET | Unified task view (DA + Pulse cron + CC triggers) |
| `/assistant/tasks` | POST | Create DA scheduled task |
| `/assistant/tasks/:id` | DELETE | Cancel DA task |
| `/assistant/diary` | GET | Recent diary entries |
| `/assistant/opinions` | GET | Current opinions |

### Tools

| Tool | Usage | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `DAInterview.ts` | `bun PAI/TOOLS/DAInterview.ts` | Create/update DA identity |
| `DASchedule.ts` | `bun PAI/TOOLS/DASchedule.ts list` | Manage scheduled tasks |
| `DAGrowth.ts` | `bun PAI/TOOLS/DAGrowth.ts summary` | View growth data |
| `DAIdentityGenerator.ts` | `bun PAI/TOOLS/DAIdentityGenerator.ts` | Regenerate DA_IDENTITY.md from YAML |

### Competitive Context

This subsystem provides all features of OpenClaw's SOUL.md identity system plus: structured schema (vs flat markdown), guided interview (vs manual editing), proactive heartbeat (matched), scheduled tasks (matched), opinion formation (novel), bounded identity growth (novel), and multi-DA support (novel). At 30-50x lower cost than OpenClaw's GPT-4 heartbeat.
