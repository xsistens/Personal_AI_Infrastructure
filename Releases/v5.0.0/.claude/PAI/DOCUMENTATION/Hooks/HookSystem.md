# Hook System

> **PAI 5.0** — Stable event-driven automation infrastructure.

**Event-Driven Automation Infrastructure**

**Location:** `~/.claude/hooks/`
**Configuration:** `~/.claude/settings.json`
**Status:** Active — hook count auto-computed by `UpdateCounts.ts` at session end

---

## Overview

The PAI hook system is an event-driven automation infrastructure built on Claude Code's native hook support. Hooks are executable scripts (TypeScript/Python) that run automatically in response to specific events during Claude Code sessions.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Session Management** - Auto-load context, capture summaries, manage state
- **Voice Notifications** - Text-to-speech announcements for task completions
- **History Capture** - Automatic work/learning documentation to `~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/`
- **Security Validation** - Active (v4.0) — Inspector Pipeline: SecurityPipeline (PreToolUse), ContentScanner (PostToolUse), SmartApprover (PermissionRequest), PromptGuard (UserPromptSubmit). See `DOCUMENTATION/Security/SecuritySystem.md`
- **Multi-Agent Support** - Agent-specific hooks with voice routing
- **Tab Titles** - Dynamic terminal tab updates with task context
- **Unified Event Stream** - All hooks emit structured events to `events.jsonl` for real-time observability

**Key Principle:** Most hooks run asynchronously and fail gracefully. Security hooks (SecurityPipeline) are synchronous and blocking — they can prevent tool execution via `exit(2)`. All `.ts` hooks have `#!/usr/bin/env bun` shebangs and `+x` permissions — settings.json references them directly (e.g., `$HOME/.claude/hooks/SecurityPipeline.hook.ts`) without a `bun` prefix. HTTP hooks (SkillGuard, AgentGuard) run via Pulse routes on `localhost:31337`.

**Freshness Authority:** When adding or modifying hooks, consult the `claude-code-guide` agent to verify current hook event types, return value schemas, and available fields.

---

## Available Hook Types

Claude Code supports the following hook events:

### 1. **SessionStart**
**When:** Claude Code session begins (new conversation)
**Use Cases:**
- Load PAI context (CLAUDE.md auto-loads routing + identity + PRINCIPAL_TELOS via @-imports)
- Initialize session state
- Capture session metadata

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "SessionStart": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/KittyEnvPersist.hook.ts"
        },
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/LoadContext.hook.ts"
        },
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/KVSync.hook.ts",
          "timeout": 10,
          "async": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What They Do:**
- `KittyEnvPersist.hook.ts` - Persists Kitty terminal env vars both to the shared `MEMORY/STATE/kitty-env.json` and to a per-session `MEMORY/STATE/kitty-sessions/{sessionId}.json` (required by out-of-process consumers like Pulse voice daemon), then resets tab title to clean state
- `LoadContext.hook.ts` - Injects dynamic context (relationship, learning, work summary) as `<system-reminder>` at session start
- `KVSync.hook.ts` - Pushes work.json to Cloudflare KV (`sync:work_state`) so admin.example.com activity dashboard has fresh data

---

### 2. **SessionEnd**
**When:** Claude Code session terminates (conversation ends)
**Use Cases:**
- Capture work completions and learning moments
- Generate session summaries
- Record relationship context
- Update system counts (skills, hooks, signals)
- Run integrity checks

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "SessionEnd": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts"
        },
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/ULWorkSync.hook.ts"
        },
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/SessionCleanup.hook.ts"
        },
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/RelationshipMemory.hook.ts"
        },
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/UpdateCounts.hook.ts"
        },
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/IntegrityCheck.hook.ts"
        },
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/KVSync.hook.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What They Do:**
- `WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts` - Reads ISA.md frontmatter for work metadata and ISC section for criteria status, captures learning to `MEMORY/LEARNING/` for significant work sessions
- `ULWorkSync.hook.ts` - Syncs UL work state at session end
- `SessionCleanup.hook.ts` - Marks ISA.md frontmatter status→COMPLETED and sets completed_at timestamp, clears session state, resets tab, cleans session names
- `RelationshipMemory.hook.ts` - Captures relationship context (observations, behaviors) to `MEMORY/RELATIONSHIP/`
- `UpdateCounts.hook.ts` - Updates system counts (skills, hooks, signals, workflows, files) displayed in the startup banner
- `IntegrityCheck.hook.ts` - Runs DocCrossRefIntegrity and SystemIntegrity checks at session end
- `KVSync.hook.ts` - Pushes work.json to Cloudflare KV so admin.example.com dashboard reflects final session state

---

### 3. **UserPromptSubmit**
**When:** User submits a new prompt to Claude
**Use Cases:**
- Update UI indicators
- Pre-process user input
- Capture prompts for analysis
- Detect ratings and sentiment

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "UserPromptSubmit": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/PromptGuard.hook.ts",
          "timeout": 10
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/PromptProcessing.hook.ts",
          "timeout": 30,
          "async": true
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/RepeatDetection.hook.ts",
          "timeout": 5
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/SatisfactionCapture.hook.ts",
          "timeout": 20,
          "async": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What It Does:**

**PromptGuard.hook.ts** - Security: PromptInspector-based scan on user prompts. Part of the v4.0 Inspector Pipeline. Heuristic-only (no LLM) detection of injection, exfiltration, evasion, and security disable attempts. **First in chain — synchronous, can block.**

**PromptProcessing.hook.ts** - Unified Prompt Analysis (Rating + Tab + Naming + Mode + Tier)
- Consolidated replacement for the former SessionAnalysis + ModeClassifier + ClassifierTelemetry split (and earlier RatingCapture + UpdateTabTitle + SessionAutoName trio)
- **One process, one Sonnet call, five outputs** — sentiment rating, tab title, session name, MODE classification (MINIMAL/NATIVE/ALGORITHM), TIER (E1–E5 when ALGORITHM)
- Fast paths (no inference): explicit ratings ("8 - great"), positive praise ("nice work"), system text
- Deterministic tab title set immediately (purple/thinking state)
- Deterministic session name on first prompt (background Sonnet upgrade follows)
- Sonnet inference returns the five outputs as a single JSON line written into additionalContext
- Sets tab to orange/working state with inferred title + voice announcement
- Low ratings (<5) auto-capture as learning opportunities
- Writes to: `ratings.jsonl`, `session-names.json`, `work.json`, tab state, voice server, `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/mode-classifier.jsonl`
- **Inference:** `import { inference } from "~/.claude/PAI/TOOLS/Inference.ts"` → Sonnet level
- **Performance:** Fast paths <50ms, inference path ~3-8s (deliberate cost of better mode/tier judgment than regex could provide)
- **Failsafe:** any classifier error path (timeout 25s, non-zero exit, unparseable JSON) defaults to ALGORITHM E3 with `SOURCE: fail-safe`
- **Naming-context isolation (2026-04-19):** `getRecentContext()` strips Assistant turns when `isFirstPrompt` is true. Session names are permanent, so Algorithm scaffolding in assistant output — phase headers, agent names, SUMMARY lines — must never reach the naming prompt.

**RepeatDetection.hook.ts** - Detect repeated asks / repeat-request complaints from the user. Synchronous, short-timeout.

**SatisfactionCapture.hook.ts** - Captures user satisfaction signals from prompt content for analytics and learning. Async.

> **Migration note:** Older hooks (RatingCapture, UpdateTabTitle, SessionAutoName, SessionAnalysis, ModeClassifier, ClassifierTelemetry) are no longer wired in settings.json. The active chain is the four hooks above.

---

### 4. **Stop**
**When:** Main agent ({DA_IDENTITY.NAME}) completes a response
**Use Cases:**
- Voice notifications for task completion
- Capture work summaries and learnings
- **Update terminal tab with final state** (color + suffix based on outcome)

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "Stop": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/LastResponseCache.hook.ts" },
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/ResponseTabReset.hook.ts" },
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/VoiceCompletion.hook.ts" },
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/DocIntegrity.hook.ts" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What They Do:**

Each Stop hook is a self-contained `.hook.ts` file that reads stdin via shared `hooks/lib/hook-io.ts`, calls its handler, and exits. Handlers in `hooks/handlers/` are unchanged — each hook is a thin wrapper.

**`LastResponseCache.hook.ts`** — Cache last response for PromptProcessing bridge
- Writes `last_assistant_message` (or transcript fallback) to `MEMORY/STATE/last-response.txt`
- PromptProcessing reads this on the next UserPromptSubmit to access the previous response

**`ResponseTabReset.hook.ts`** — Reset Kitty tab title/color after response
- Calls `handlers/TabState.ts` to set completed state
- Converts working gerund title to past tense

**`VoiceCompletion.hook.ts`** — Send 🗣️ voice line to TTS server
- Calls `handlers/VoiceNotification.ts` for voice delivery
- Voice gate: only main sessions (checks `kitty-sessions/{sessionId}.json`)
- Subagents have no kitty-sessions file → voice blocked

**`DocIntegrity.hook.ts`** — Cross-reference + semantic drift checks + architecture summary regen
- Calls `handlers/DocCrossRefIntegrity.ts` — deterministic + inference-powered doc updates
- Calls `handlers/RebuildArchSummary.ts` — regenerates `PAI_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` when system files change
- Self-gating: returns instantly when no system files were modified

**Tab State System:** See `TERMINALTABS.md` for complete documentation

---

### 5. **PreToolUse**
**When:** Before Claude executes any tool
**Use Cases:**
- Voice curl gating (prevent background agents from speaking)
- Security validation across file operations (Bash, Edit, Write, Read, MultiEdit) — SecurityPipeline (Pattern → Egress → Rules inspectors) blocks dangerous commands, protects credentials, enforces path tiers
- Tab state updates on questions
- Agent execution guardrails — Pulse HTTP route at localhost:31337/hooks/agent-guard
- Skill invocation validation — Pulse HTTP route at localhost:31337/hooks/skill-guard

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/SecurityPipeline.hook.ts" },
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/ContextReduction.hook.sh" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit|Read",
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/SecurityPipeline.hook.ts" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "matcher": "Skill",
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:31337/hooks/skill-guard" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "matcher": "Agent",
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:31337/hooks/agent-guard" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "matcher": "AskUserQuestion",
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/SetQuestionTab.hook.ts" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Security hooks (active, v4.0 Inspector Pipeline):** SecurityPipeline runs on Bash/Write/Edit/MultiEdit matchers (composable inspector chain: PatternInspector(100) → EgressInspector(90); RulesInspector(50) disabled — empty SECURITY_RULES.md; exit(2) hard-block). ContentScanner runs on PostToolUse WebFetch/WebSearch matchers (InjectionInspector for prompt injection detection in external content). SmartApprover runs on PermissionRequest (trusted workspace auto-approval + read/write classification). PromptGuard runs on UserPromptSubmit (PromptInspector(95) — heuristic-only injection/exfiltration/evasion/security-disable detection, no LLM). SkillGuard and AgentGuard run via Pulse HTTP routes (`localhost:31337`). AgentGuard also injects a Monitor watchdog reminder for background agents (`run_in_background: true`) — `Tools/AgentWatchdog.ts` monitors tool-activity.jsonl for silence and alerts when agents may be hung. Inspector core: `hooks/security/{types,pipeline,logger}.ts`, inspectors: `hooks/security/inspectors/`. See `DOCUMENTATION/Security/SecuritySystem.md` for full architecture.

**What They Do:**
- `ContextReduction.hook.sh` - Context reduction via [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk). Transparently rewrites Bash commands to `rtk` equivalents for 60-90% token reduction across git, build, test, lint, and package manager output. Runs on the Bash matcher. Meta commands (use directly, not through hook): `rtk gain` (savings analytics), `rtk gain --history` (command history), `rtk discover` (missed opportunities), `rtk proxy <cmd>` (bypass filtering). Note: if `rtk gain` fails, check for name collision with reachingforthejack/rtk (Rust Type Kit).
- `SetQuestionTab.hook.ts` - Updates tab state to "awaiting input" when AskUserQuestion is invoked

---

### 6. **PostToolUse**
**When:** After Claude executes any tool
**Status:** Active - Algorithm state tracking

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "PostToolUse": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/ContentScanner.hook.ts" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "matcher": "AskUserQuestion",
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/QuestionAnswered.hook.ts" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "matcher": "Write",
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/ISASync.hook.ts" },
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/TelosSummarySync.hook.ts" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "matcher": "Edit",
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/ISASync.hook.ts" },
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/TelosSummarySync.hook.ts" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "hooks": [
        { "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/ToolActivityTracker.hook.ts" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What They Do:**

**ContentScanner.hook.ts** - Prompt Injection Detection (Security v4.0)
- Fires after any tool use (global matcher)
- Runs InjectionInspector from the Inspector Pipeline to detect prompt injection attempts in tool output
- Part of the v4.0 security architecture; replaces the former PromptInjectionScanner
- Inspector source: `hooks/security/inspectors/`

**QuestionAnswered.hook.ts** - Post-Question Processing
- Fires after AskUserQuestion completes (user has answered)
- Captures the question and answer for session context
- Used for analytics and learning from user preferences

**ISASync.hook.ts** - ISA Frontmatter → work.json Sync
- Fires after Write/Edit to ISA files in `MEMORY/WORK/`
- Syncs ISA frontmatter (status, title, effort) to `MEMORY/STATE/work.json`
- Keeps work registry in sync without manual updates
- Non-blocking, fire-and-forget
- Uses `hooks/lib/isa-utils.ts::appendPhase()` (2026-04-16+) for phaseHistory with `source: "prd"` — the other source being voice notifications. Both feed the same phaseHistory array with dedup via upgrade to `source: "merged"`. See `PAI/MEMORY/KNOWLEDGE/Ideas/dual-source-event-tracking-pattern.md`.

**TelosSummarySync.hook.ts** - Principal TELOS Sync
- Fires after Write/Edit alongside ISASync
- Regenerates PRINCIPAL_TELOS.md when TELOS source files are modified

**ToolActivityTracker.hook.ts** - Tool Activity Tracking + Ground-Truth Audit
- Fires after any tool use (global matcher)
- Tracks tool usage patterns for observability
- Captures a `ground_truth` payload for write-class tools (Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit): file path, bounded before/after diff, git HEAD + dirty flag
- Captures a `ground_truth` payload for Bash: command, stdout/stderr preview, exit code
- Feeds the Observer Team archetype (see PAIAGENTSYSTEM.md) which consumes the audit log rather than chat transcripts — watches what the model DID, not what it said

---

### 7. **PostToolUseFailure**
**When:** A tool execution fails
**Use Cases:**
- Track tool failure patterns for debugging
- Identify flaky tools or recurring errors
- Observability data for system health

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "PostToolUseFailure": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/ToolFailureTracker.hook.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What It Does:**
- `ToolFailureTracker.hook.ts` - Appends structured failure events to `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/tool-failures.jsonl`
- Captures: tool name, error message, truncated tool input, session ID, timestamp
- Lightweight (<20ms) — file append only, no inference calls

---

### 8. **SubagentStart**
**When:** A subagent is spawned (command-only event)
**Status:** Empty registration. Claude Code's built-in `SubagentStart` payload omits `subagent_type` / `description` / `prompt`, so PAI tracks subagent lifecycle at the `PreToolUse:Agent` boundary via `AgentInvocation.hook.ts` (see Section 1) where that data is reliably present.

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "SubagentStart": []
}
```

---

### 9. **ConfigChange**
**When:** Configuration settings are modified (command-only event)
**Use Cases:**
- Security audit trail for permission changes
- Track hook modifications
- Detect unauthorized config changes

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "ConfigChange": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/ConfigAudit.hook.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What It Does:**
- `ConfigAudit.hook.ts` - Appends config change events to `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/config-changes.jsonl`
- Captures: config key, change summary (old → new), session ID, timestamp
- Flags sensitive keys (permissions, hooks, env, mcpServers) with extra logging
- Lightweight (<20ms) — file append only, no inference calls

---

### 10. **PreCompact**
**When:** Before Claude compacts context (long conversations)
**Status:** Active — `PreCompact.hook.ts`
**Matcher:** `"*"` (both auto and manual compaction)

**What It Does:**
- `PreCompact.hook.ts` - Captures active work context before conversation compaction
- Reads: `MEMORY/STATE/current-work*.json`, `MEMORY/WORK/*/ISA.md`
- Outputs structured handover note to stdout (preserved through compaction)
- Captures: active task, ISA summary, files modified, key decisions, working directory, session ID
- Lightweight (<100ms) — file reads only, no inference calls

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "PreCompact": [
    {
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/PreCompact.hook.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Relationship to Auto-Memory:**
Claude Code's built-in auto-memory system writes learnings to `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/MEMORY.md`. The PreCompact hook complements this by preserving work-in-progress state that auto-memory doesn't capture (active task context, ISA state, file lists). Auto-dream (server-controlled) periodically consolidates auto-memory files between sessions.

---

### 11. **PostCompact**
**When:** After Claude compacts context
**Status:** Active — `RestoreContext.hook.ts`

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "PostCompact": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/RestoreContext.hook.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What It Does:**
- `RestoreContext.hook.ts` - Restores critical context after compaction to prevent context loss

---

### 12. **SubagentStop**
**When:** A subagent completes (command-only event)
**Status:** Empty registration. Subagent stop + duration is tracked at `PostToolUse:Agent` via `AgentInvocation.hook.ts` (see Section 1).

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "SubagentStop": []
}
```

---

### 12a. **TeammateIdle**
**When:** An agent team teammate is about to go idle
**Status:** Active — `TeammateIdle.hook.ts`

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "TeammateIdle": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/TeammateIdle.hook.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What It Does:**
- `TeammateIdle.hook.ts` - Logs idle events to `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/teammate-events.jsonl`
- Pure logging — does not block or redirect teammates
- Captures: teammate name, team name, session ID, timestamp

---

### 13. **TaskCreated**
**When:** A task is created via TaskCreate tool
**Status:** Active — `TaskGovernance.hook.ts`

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "TaskCreated": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/TaskGovernance.hook.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What It Does:**
- `TaskGovernance.hook.ts` - Validates and governs task creation for ISC quality standards

---

### 14. **StopFailure**
**When:** The main agent fails to complete a response
**Status:** Active — `StopFailureHandler.hook.ts`

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "StopFailure": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/StopFailureHandler.hook.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What It Does:**
- `StopFailureHandler.hook.ts` - Handles stop failures, captures error context for debugging

---

### 15. **Elicitation**
**When:** An elicitation event occurs
**Status:** Active — `ElicitationHandler.hook.ts`

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "Elicitation": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/ElicitationHandler.hook.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What It Does:**
- `ElicitationHandler.hook.ts` - Handles elicitation events for interactive user engagement

---

### 16. **FileChanged**
**When:** A file is changed on disk (external to Claude)
**Status:** Active — `FileChanged.hook.ts`

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "FileChanged": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/FileChanged.hook.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What It Does:**
- `FileChanged.hook.ts` - Reacts to external file changes, enabling watch-mode behaviors

---

### 17. **InstructionsLoaded**
**When:** Instructions (CLAUDE.md or project instructions) are loaded
**Status:** Active — `InstructionsLoadedHandler.hook.ts`

**Current Hooks:**
```json
{
  "InstructionsLoaded": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/InstructionsLoadedHandler.hook.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**What It Does:**
- `InstructionsLoadedHandler.hook.ts` - Processes loaded instructions for context enrichment or validation

---

## Configuration

### Location
**File:** `~/.claude/settings.json`
**Section:** `"hooks": { ... }`

### Environment Variables
Hooks have access to all environment variables from `~/.claude/settings.json` `"env"` section:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "PAI_DIR": "$HOME/.claude",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS": "64000"
  }
}
```

**Key Variables:**
- `PAI_DIR` - PAI installation directory (typically `~/.claude`)
- Hook scripts reference `$HOME/.claude` in command paths

### Identity Configuration (Central to Install Wizard)

**settings.json is the single source of truth for all daidentity/configuration.**

```json
{
  "daidentity": {
    "name": "PAI",
    "fullName": "Personal AI",
    "displayName": "PAI",
    "color": "#3B82F6",
    "voices": {
      "main": { "voiceId": "{YourElevenLabsVoiceId}", "stability": 0.85, "similarityBoost": 0.7 },
      "algorithm": { "voiceId": "{AlgorithmVoiceId}" }
    }
  },
  "principal": {
    "name": "{YourName}",
    "pronunciation": "{YourName}",
    "timezone": "America/Your_City"
  }
}
```

**Using the Identity Module:**
```typescript
import { getIdentity, getPrincipal, getDAName, getPrincipalName, getVoiceId } from './lib/identity';

// Get full identity objects
const identity = getIdentity();    // { name, fullName, displayName, mainDAVoiceID, color, voice, personality }
const principal = getPrincipal();  // { name, pronunciation, timezone }

// Convenience functions
const DA_NAME = getDAName();        // "PAI"
const USER_NAME = getPrincipalName(); // "{YourName}"
const VOICE_ID = getVoiceId();        // from settings.json daidentity.voices.main.voiceId
```

**Why settings.json?**
- Programmatic access via `JSON.parse()` - no regex parsing markdown
- Central to the PAI install wizard
- Tool-friendly: easy to read/write from any language

> **Note:** `settings.json` is now a **generated file** -- `ConfigRenderer.ts` writes it at session start from `PAI_CONFIG.yaml`. Hooks should read it freely for runtime config, but understand that manual edits will be overwritten on next session start when ConfigRenderer detects a hash change. To make permanent config changes, edit `PAI_CONFIG.yaml` instead.

### Hook Configuration Structure

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "HookEventName": [
      {
        "matcher": "pattern",  // Optional: filter which tools/events trigger hook
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/my-hook.ts --arg value"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Fields:**
- `HookEventName` - One of: SessionStart, SessionEnd, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, StopFailure, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PostToolUseFailure, SubagentStart, SubagentStop, ConfigChange, PreCompact, PostCompact, TaskCreated, TaskCompleted, TeammateIdle, Elicitation, ElicitationResult, FileChanged, CwdChanged, InstructionsLoaded, WorktreeCreate, WorktreeRemove, Notification, PermissionRequest
- `matcher` - Pattern to match (use `"*"` for all tools, or specific tool names)
- `type` - Always `"command"` (executes external script)
- `command` - Path to executable hook script (TypeScript/Python/Bash)

### Hook Input (stdin)
All hooks receive JSON data on stdin:

```typescript
{
  session_id: string;         // Unique session identifier
  transcript_path: string;    // Path to JSONL transcript
  hook_event_name: string;    // Event that triggered hook
  prompt?: string;            // User prompt (UserPromptSubmit only)
  tool_name?: string;         // Tool name (PreToolUse/PostToolUse)
  tool_input?: any;           // Tool parameters (PreToolUse)
  tool_output?: any;          // Tool result (PostToolUse)
  // ... event-specific fields
}
```

---

## Common Patterns

### 1. Voice Notifications

**Pattern:** Extract completion message → Send to voice server

```typescript
// handlers/VoiceNotification.ts pattern
import { getIdentity } from './lib/identity';

const identity = getIdentity();
const completionMessage = extractCompletionMessage(lastMessage);

const payload = {
  title: identity.name,
  message: completionMessage,
  voice_enabled: true,
  voice_id: identity.mainDAVoiceID  // From settings.json
};

await fetch('http://localhost:31337/notify', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});
```

**Agent-Specific Voices:**
Configure voice IDs via `settings.json` daidentity section or environment variables.
Each agent can have a unique ElevenLabs voice configured. See the Agents skill for voice registry.

---

### 2. History Capture (UOCS Pattern)

**Pattern:** Parse structured response → Save to appropriate history directory

**File Naming Convention:**
```
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_TYPE_description.md
```

**Types:**
- `WORK` - General task completions
- `LEARNING` - Problem-solving learnings
- `SESSION` - Session summaries
- `RESEARCH` - Research findings (from agents)
- `FEATURE` - Feature implementations (from agents)
- `DECISION` - Architectural decisions (from agents)

**Example pattern (from WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts):**
```typescript
import { getLearningCategory, isLearningCapture } from './lib/learning-utils';
import { getPSTTimestamp, getYearMonth } from './lib/time';

const structured = extractStructuredSections(lastMessage);
const isLearning = isLearningCapture(text, structured.summary, structured.analysis);

// If learning content detected, capture to LEARNING/
if (isLearning) {
  const category = getLearningCategory(text);  // 'SYSTEM' or 'ALGORITHM'
  const targetDir = join(baseDir, 'MEMORY', 'LEARNING', category, getYearMonth());
  const filename = generateFilename(description, 'LEARNING');
  writeFileSync(join(targetDir, filename), content);
}
```

**Structured Sections Parsed:**
- `📋 SUMMARY:` - Brief overview
- `🔍 ANALYSIS:` - Key findings
- `⚡ ACTIONS:` - Steps taken
- `✅ RESULTS:` - Outcomes
- `📊 STATUS:` - Current state
- `➡️ NEXT:` - Follow-up actions
- `🎯 COMPLETED:` - **Voice notification line**

---

### 3. Agent Type Detection

**Pattern:** Identify which agent is executing → Route appropriately

```typescript
// Agent detection pattern
let agentName = getAgentForSession(sessionId);

// Detect from Task tool
if (hookData.tool_name === 'Task' && hookData.tool_input?.subagent_type) {
  agentName = hookData.tool_input.subagent_type;
  setAgentForSession(sessionId, agentName);
}

// Detect from CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT env variable
else if (process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT) {
  agentName = process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT;
}

// Detect from path (subagents run in /agents/name/)
else if (hookData.cwd && hookData.cwd.includes('/agents/')) {
  const agentMatch = hookData.cwd.match(/\/agents\/([^\/]+)/);
  if (agentMatch) agentName = agentMatch[1];
}
```

**Session Mapping:** `~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/agent-sessions.json`
```json
{
  "session-id-abc123": "engineer",
  "session-id-def456": "researcher"
}
```

---

### 4. Tab Title + Color State Architecture

**Pattern:** Visual state feedback through tab colors and title suffixes

**State Flow:**

| Event | Hook | Tab Title | Inactive Color | State |
|-------|------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| UserPromptSubmit | `PromptProcessing.hook.ts` | `⚙️ Summary…` | Orange `#B35A00` | Working |
| Inference | `PromptProcessing.hook.ts` | `🧠 Analyzing…` | Orange `#B35A00` | Inference |
| Stop (success) | `handlers/TabState.ts` | `Summary` | Green `#022800` | Completed |
| Stop (question) | `handlers/TabState.ts` | `Summary?` | Teal `#0D4F4F` | Awaiting Input |
| Stop (error) | `handlers/TabState.ts` | `Summary!` | Orange `#B35A00` | Error |

**Active Tab:** Always Dark Blue `#002B80` (state colors only affect inactive tabs)

**Why This Design:**
- **Instant visual feedback** - See state at a glance without reading
- **Color-coded priority** - Teal tabs need attention, green tabs are done
- **Suffix as state indicator** - Works even in narrow tab bars
- **Haiku only on user input** - One AI call per prompt (not per tool)

**State Detection (in Stop hook):**
1. Check transcript for `AskUserQuestion` tool → `awaitingInput`
2. Check `📊 STATUS:` for error patterns → `error`
3. Default → `completed`

**Text Colors:**
- Active tab: White `#FFFFFF` (always)
- Inactive tab: Gray `#A0A0A0` (always)

**Active Tab Background:** Dark Blue `#002B80` (always - state colors only affect inactive tabs)

**Tab Icons:**
- 🧠 Brain - AI inference in progress (Haiku/Sonnet thinking)
- ⚙️ Gear - Processing/working state

**Full Documentation:** See `~/.claude/PAI/DOCUMENTATION/Pulse/TerminalTabs.md`

---

### 5. Async Non-Blocking Execution

**Pattern:** Hook executes quickly → Launch background processes for slow operations

```typescript
// PromptProcessing.hook.ts pattern
// Set immediate tab title (fast)
execSync(`printf '\\033]0;${titleWithEmoji}\\007' >&2`);

// Launch background process for Haiku summary (slow)
Bun.spawn(['bun', `${paiDir}/hooks/PromptProcessing.hook.ts`, prompt], {
  stdout: 'ignore',
  stderr: 'ignore',
  stdin: 'ignore'
});

process.exit(0);  // Exit immediately
```

**Key Principle:** Hooks must never block Claude Code. Always exit quickly, use background processes for slow work.

---

### 6. Graceful Failure

**Pattern:** Wrap everything in try/catch → Log errors → Exit successfully

```typescript
async function main() {
  try {
    // Hook logic here
  } catch (error) {
    // Log but don't fail
    console.error('Hook error:', error);
  }

  process.exit(0);  // Always exit 0
}
```

**Why:** If hooks crash, Claude Code may freeze. Always exit cleanly.

---

## Creating Custom Hooks

### Step 1: Choose Hook Event
Decide which event should trigger your hook (SessionStart, Stop, PostToolUse, etc.)

### Step 2: Create Hook Script

**Template:**
```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env bun

interface HookInput {
  session_id: string;
  transcript_path: string;
  hook_event_name: string;
  // ... event-specific fields
}

async function main() {
  try {
    // Read stdin
    const input = await Bun.stdin.text();
    const data: HookInput = JSON.parse(input);

    // Your hook logic here
    console.log(`Hook triggered: ${data.hook_event_name}`);

    // Example: Read transcript
    const fs = require('fs');
    const transcript = fs.readFileSync(data.transcript_path, 'utf-8');

    // Do something with the data

  } catch (error) {
    // Log but don't fail
    console.error('Hook error:', error);
  }

  process.exit(0);  // Always exit 0
}

main();
```

### Step 3: Make Executable
```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/my-custom-hook.ts
```
> **Note:** Not needed when using the `bun` prefix in settings.json — all PAI hooks use `bun $HOME/.claude/hooks/...` which doesn't require the execute bit.

### Step 4: Add to settings.json
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/my-custom-hook.ts"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Test
```bash
# Test hook directly
echo '{"session_id":"test","transcript_path":"/tmp/test.jsonl","hook_event_name":"Stop"}' | bun ~/.claude/hooks/my-custom-hook.ts
```

### Step 6: Restart Claude Code
Hooks are loaded at startup. Restart to apply changes.

---

## Hook Development Best Practices

### 1. **Fast Execution**
- Hooks should complete in < 500ms
- Use background processes for slow work (Haiku API calls, file processing)
- Exit immediately after launching background work

### 2. **Graceful Failure**
- Always wrap in try/catch
- Log errors to stderr (available in hook debug logs)
- Always `process.exit(0)` - never throw or exit(1)

### 3. **Non-Blocking**
- Never wait for external services (unless they respond quickly)
- Use `.catch(() => {})` for async operations
- Fail silently if optional services are offline

### 4. **Stdin Reading**
- Use timeout when reading stdin (Claude Code may not send data immediately)
- Handle empty/invalid input gracefully

```typescript
const decoder = new TextDecoder();
const reader = Bun.stdin.stream().getReader();

const timeoutPromise = new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve(), 500);  // 500ms timeout
});

await Promise.race([readPromise, timeoutPromise]);
```

### 5. **File I/O**
- Check `existsSync()` before reading files
- Create directories with `{ recursive: true }`
- Use local-timezone timestamps for consistency (the utility resolves from your PAI config)

### 6. **Environment Access**
- All `settings.json` env vars available via `process.env`
- Use `$HOME/.claude` in settings.json for portability
- Access in code via `process.env.PAI_DIR`

### 7. **Logging**
- Log useful debug info to stderr for troubleshooting
- Include relevant metadata (session_id, tool_name, etc.)
- Never log sensitive data (API keys, user content)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running

**Check:**
1. Is hook script executable? `chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/my-hook.ts` (not needed when using `bun` prefix — all PAI hooks use `bun` prefix)
2. Is path correct in settings.json? Use `bun $HOME/.claude/hooks/...`
3. Is settings.json valid JSON? `jq . ~/.claude/settings.json`
4. Did you restart Claude Code after editing settings.json?

**Debug:**
```bash
# Test hook directly
echo '{"session_id":"test","transcript_path":"/tmp/test.jsonl","hook_event_name":"Stop"}' | bun ~/.claude/hooks/my-hook.ts

# Check hook logs (stderr output)
tail -f ~/.claude/hooks/debug.log  # If you add logging
```

---

### Hook Hangs/Freezes Claude Code

**Cause:** Hook not exiting (infinite loop, waiting for input, blocking operation)

**Fix:**
1. Add timeouts to all blocking operations
2. Ensure `process.exit(0)` is always reached
3. Use background processes for long operations
4. Check stdin reading has timeout

**Prevention:**
```typescript
// Always use timeout
setTimeout(() => {
  console.error('Hook timeout - exiting');
  process.exit(0);
}, 5000);  // 5 second max
```

---

### Voice Notifications Not Working

**Check:**
1. Is voice server running? `curl http://localhost:31337/health`
2. Is voice_id correct? See `settings.json` `daidentity.voices` for mappings
3. Is message format correct? `{"message":"...", "voice_id":"...", "title":"..."}`
4. Is ElevenLabs API key in `~/.claude/.env`?

**Debug:**
```bash
# Test voice server directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Test message","voice_id":"[YOUR_VOICE_ID]","title":"Test"}'
```

**Common Issues:**
- Wrong voice_id → Silent failure (invalid ID)
- Voice server offline → Hook continues (graceful failure)
- No `🎯 COMPLETED:` line → No voice notification extracted

---

### Work Not Capturing

**Check:**
1. Does `~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/` directory exist?
2. Does current-work file exist? Check `~/.claude/`
3. Is hook actually running? Check `~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/RAW/` for events
4. File permissions? `ls -la ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/WORK/`

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check current work
cat ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/current-work.json

# Check recent work directories
ls -lt ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/WORK/ | head -10
ls -lt ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/LEARNING/$(date +%Y-%m)/ | head -10

# Check raw events
tail ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/RAW/$(date +%Y-%m)/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_all-events.jsonl
```

**Common Issues:**
- Missing current-work.json → Work not being tracked for this session
- Work not updating → capture handler not finding current work
- Learning detection too strict → Adjust `isLearningCapture()` logic

---

### Stop Event Not Firing (RESOLVED)

**Original Issue:** Stop events were not firing consistently in earlier Claude Code versions, causing voice notifications and work capture to fail silently.

**Resolution:** Fixed in Claude Code updates. The Stop hooks now fire reliably. The individual hook pattern (each `.hook.ts` delegating to `handlers/`) was implemented in part to work around this — and remains the production architecture.

**Status:** RESOLVED — Stop events now fire reliably. Individual Stop hooks handle all post-response work.

---

### Agent Detection Failing

**Check:**
1. Is `~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/agent-sessions.json` writable?
2. Is `[AGENT:type]` tag in `🎯 COMPLETED:` line?
3. Is agent running from correct directory? (`/agents/name/`)

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check session mappings
cat ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/agent-sessions.json | jq .

# Check subagent-stop debug log
tail -f ~/.claude/hooks/subagent-stop-debug.log
```

**Fix:**
- Ensure agents include `[AGENT:type]` in completion line
- Verify Task tool passes `subagent_type` parameter
- Check cwd includes `/agents/` in path

---

### Transcript Type Mismatch (Fixed 2026-01-11)

**Symptom:** Context reading functions return empty results even though transcript has data

**Root Cause:** Claude Code transcripts use `type: "user"` but hooks were checking for `type: "human"`.

**Affected Hooks:**
- `PromptProcessing.hook.ts` - Couldn't read user messages for context
- `SatisfactionCapture.hook.ts` - Same issue

**Fix Applied:**
1. Changed `entry.type === 'human'` → `entry.type === 'user'`
2. Improved content extraction to skip `tool_result` blocks and only capture actual text

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check transcript type field
grep '"type":"user"' "$(ls -d ~/.claude/projects/*/ | head -1)"*.jsonl | head -1 | jq '.type'
# Should output: "user" (not "human")
```

**Prevention:** When parsing transcripts, always verify the actual JSON structure first.

---

### Context Loading Issues (SessionStart)

**Check:**
1. Does `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` exist?
2. Is `LoadContext.hook.ts` executable?
3. Is `PAI_DIR` env variable set correctly?

**Debug:**
```bash
# Test context loading directly
bun ~/.claude/hooks/LoadContext.hook.ts

# Should output <system-reminder> with SKILL.md content
```

**Common Issues:**
- Subagent sessions loading main context → Fixed (subagent detection in hook)
- File not found → Check `PAI_DIR` environment variable
- Permission denied → `chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/LoadContext.hook.ts` (not needed when using `bun` prefix — all PAI hooks use `bun` prefix)

---

## Advanced Topics

### Multi-Hook Execution Order

Hooks in same event execute **sequentially** in order defined in settings.json:

```json
{
  "Stop": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        { "command": "$HOME/.claude/hooks/VoiceCompletion.hook.ts" }  // Example: one of several Stop hooks
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** If first hook hangs, second won't run. Keep hooks fast!

---

### Matcher Patterns

`"matcher"` field filters which events trigger hook:

```json
{
  "PostToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Bash",  // Only Bash tool executions
      "hooks": [...]
    },
    {
      "matcher": "*",     // All tool executions
      "hooks": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Patterns:**
- `"*"` - All events
- `"Bash"` - Specific tool name
- `""` - Empty (all events, same as `*`)

---

### Hook Data Payloads by Event Type

**SessionStart:**
```typescript
{
  session_id: string;
  transcript_path: string;
  hook_event_name: "SessionStart";
  cwd: string;
}
```

**UserPromptSubmit:**
```typescript
{
  session_id: string;
  transcript_path: string;
  hook_event_name: "UserPromptSubmit";
  prompt: string;  // The user's prompt text
}
```

**PreToolUse:**
```typescript
{
  session_id: string;
  transcript_path: string;
  hook_event_name: "PreToolUse";
  tool_name: string;
  tool_input: any;  // Tool parameters
}
```

**PostToolUse:**
```typescript
{
  session_id: string;
  transcript_path: string;
  hook_event_name: "PostToolUse";
  tool_name: string;
  tool_input: any;
  tool_output: any;  // Tool result
  error?: string;    // If tool failed
}
```

**Stop:**
```typescript
{
  session_id: string;
  transcript_path: string;
  hook_event_name: "Stop";
}
```

**SessionEnd:**
```typescript
{
  conversation_id: string;  // Note: different field name
  timestamp: string;
}
```

## Shared Libraries

The hook system uses shared TypeScript libraries to eliminate code duplication:

### `hooks/lib/learning-utils.ts`
Shared learning categorization logic.

```typescript
import { getLearningCategory, isLearningCapture } from './lib/learning-utils';

// Categorize learning as SYSTEM (tooling/infra) or ALGORITHM (task execution)
const category = getLearningCategory(content, comment);
// Returns: 'SYSTEM' | 'ALGORITHM'

// Check if response contains learning indicators
const isLearning = isLearningCapture(text, summary, analysis);
// Returns: boolean (true if 2+ learning indicators found)
```

**Used by:** PromptProcessing, WorkCompletionLearning

### `hooks/lib/time.ts`
Shared PST timestamp utilities.

```typescript
import {
  getPSTTimestamp,    // "2026-01-10 20:30:00 PST"
  getPSTDate,         // "2026-01-10"
  getYearMonth,       // "2026-01"
  getISOTimestamp,    // ISO8601 with offset
  getFilenameTimestamp, // "2026-01-10-203000"
  getPSTComponents    // { year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds }
} from './lib/time';
```

**Used by:** PromptProcessing, WorkCompletionLearning, SessionSummary

### `hooks/lib/identity.ts`
Identity and principal configuration from settings.json.

```typescript
import { getIdentity, getPrincipal, getDAName, getPrincipalName, getVoiceId } from './lib/identity';

const identity = getIdentity();    // { name, fullName, displayName, mainDAVoiceID, color, voice, personality }
const principal = getPrincipal();  // { name, pronunciation, timezone }
```

**Used by:** handlers/VoiceNotification.ts, PromptProcessing, handlers/TabState.ts

### `PAI/TOOLS/Inference.ts`
Unified AI inference with three run levels.

```typescript
import { inference } from '../../.claude/PAI/TOOLS/Inference';

// Fast (Haiku) - quick tasks, 15s timeout
const result = await inference({
  systemPrompt: 'Summarize in 3 words',
  userPrompt: text,
  level: 'fast',
});

// Standard (Sonnet) - balanced reasoning, 30s timeout
const result = await inference({
  systemPrompt: 'Analyze sentiment',
  userPrompt: text,
  level: 'standard',
  expectJson: true,
});

// Smart (Opus) - deep reasoning, 90s timeout
const result = await inference({
  systemPrompt: 'Strategic analysis',
  userPrompt: text,
  level: 'smart',
});

// Result shape
interface InferenceResult {
  success: boolean;
  output: string;
  parsed?: unknown;  // if expectJson: true
  error?: string;
  latencyMs: number;
  level: 'fast' | 'standard' | 'smart';
}
```

**Used by:** PromptProcessing (consolidated from RatingCapture + UpdateTabTitle + SessionAutoName + SessionAnalysis + ModeClassifier + ClassifierTelemetry)

## Unified Event System

Alongside existing filesystem state writes (algorithm-state JSON, ISAs, session-names.json, etc.), hooks can emit structured events to a single append-only JSONL log. This provides a unified observability layer without replacing any existing state management.

### Components


### Usage in Hooks

Hooks call `appendEvent()` as a secondary write **alongside** their existing state writes. The emitter is synchronous, fire-and-forget, and silently swallows errors so it never blocks or crashes a hook.

```typescript
// Inside an existing hook, AFTER the normal state write:
// appendEvent() writes to ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/events.jsonl
appendEvent({ type: 'work.created', source: 'ISASync', slug: 'my-task' });
```

### Event Structure

Every event has a common base shape plus type-specific fields:
- `timestamp` (ISO 8601) -- auto-injected by `appendEvent()`
- `session_id` -- auto-injected from `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env
- `source` -- the hook or handler name that emitted the event
- `type` -- dot-separated topic (e.g., `algorithm.phase`, `work.created`, `voice.sent`, `rating.captured`)

Events use a dot-separated topic hierarchy for filtering. A `custom.*` escape hatch allows arbitrary extension without modifying the type system.

### Event Type Categories

| Category | Types | Emitting Hooks |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| `work.*` | created, completed | ISASync, SessionCleanup |
| `session.*` | named, completed | SessionCleanup |
| `rating.*` | captured | SatisfactionCapture |
| `learning.*` | captured | WorkCompletionLearning |
| `voice.*` | sent | VoiceNotification |
| `isa.*` | synced | ISASync |
| `doc.*` | integrity | DocIntegrity |
| `build.*` | rebuild | RebuildSkill (DocRebuild handler) |
| `system.*` | integrity | IntegrityCheck |
| `settings.*` | counts_updated | UpdateCounts |
| `tab.*` | updated | TabState, PromptProcessing |
| `hook.*` | error | Any hook (error reporting) |
| `custom.*` | user-defined | Extensibility escape hatch |

### Consuming Events

```bash
# Live tail (real-time monitoring)
tail -f ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/events.jsonl | jq

# Filter by type
tail -f ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/events.jsonl | jq 'select(.type | startswith("algorithm."))'

# Programmatic (Node/Bun fs.watch)
import { watch } from 'fs';
const eventsPath = `${process.env.HOME}/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/STATE/events.jsonl`;
watch(eventsPath, (eventType) => { /* read new lines */ });
```

### Key Principles

- **Additive only** -- events supplement existing state files, they never replace them
- **Append-only** -- `events.jsonl` is an immutable log, never rewritten or truncated by hooks
- **Graceful failure** -- write errors are swallowed; events are observability, not critical path
- **One file** -- all event types go to a single `events.jsonl` for simple tailing and watching
